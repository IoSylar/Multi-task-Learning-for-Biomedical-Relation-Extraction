977	DDI-false	Additive CNS depression may occur when antihistamines are administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$ including barbiturates, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
978	DDI-false	Valproate: Available data suggest that there is no significant effect of valproate on the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state, Therefore, the addition of valproate is not expected to cause a clinically important effect on Felbatol  (@DRUG$) plasma concentrations.

1008	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
1009	DDI-false	@DRUG$: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1010	DDI-false	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when @DRUG$ and valproate are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of @DRUG$ should be made.

1014	DDI-false	- When Bezalip or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of @DRUG$ or @DRUG$ is impaired
1015	DDI-false	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1016	DDI-false	In clinical studies performed with Fondaparinux, the concomitant use of oral anticoagulants (warfarin), platelet inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid), NSAIDs (piroxicam), and @DRUG$ did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of @DRUG$.

1182	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
1183	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as @DRUG$ and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
1184	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1185	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
1186	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other @DRUG$, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1187	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.
1188	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1189	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
1190	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
1191	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1192	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
1193	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
1194	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.

1199	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
1200	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
1201	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and @DRUG$.
1202	DDI-mechanism	In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of @DRUG$ given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg @DRUG$ increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.
1203	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with HEXALEN and/or @DRUG$.1
1204	DDI-effect	Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1205	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
1206	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin, and @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
1207	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with @DRUG$ (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
1208	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1209	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by @DRUG$.
1210	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
1211	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
1212	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
1213	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, @DRUG$, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
1214	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1215	DDI-effect	Antihypertensives: @DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
1216	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1217	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., @DRUG$, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
1218	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
1219	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, @DRUG$ and interferon-alfa.
1220	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
1221	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
1222	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace coumarin anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$, from their protein-binding sites.
1223	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1224	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1225	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
1226	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
1227	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
1228	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
1229	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with @DRUG$
1230	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
1231	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, @DRUG$, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1359	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
1360	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including @DRUG$ and cimetidine, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
1361	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
1362	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as phenytoin or @DRUG$ from their binding sites.
1363	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may decrease the hemodynamic effects of @DRUG$;"

1365	DDI-effect	- Methotrexate (e.g., Mexate) Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the liver and/or the side effects of methotrexate
1366	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
1367	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
1368	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when @DRUG$ and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
1369	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1370	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1371	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and glutethimide should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
1372	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
1373	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, @DRUG$ (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.

1375	DDI-advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their @DRUG$ dosage when @DRUG$ is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
1376	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
1377	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
1378	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1379	DDI-effect	Phenothiazines and @DRUG$ may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
1380	DDI-effect	The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is unknown, and the concomitant use of two potentially hepatotoxic medications is not ordinarily recommended unless the probable benefits outweigh the known risks.
1381	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.

1398	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
1399	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, renal excretion of loracarbef is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
1400	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
1401	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other @DRUG$ cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
1402	DDI-mechanism	However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either @DRUG$ 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.
1403	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease @DRUG$ concentrations.

1417	DDI-effect	In patients who have received muscle relaxants, @DRUG$ may temporarily mask the residual effects of @DRUG$.
1418	DDI-effect	When taken orally , imidazole compounds like @DRUG$ may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
1419	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with @DRUG$, Innovar Vet, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
1420	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ as compared to a non-matched historicalcontrol group resulted in a 30%, 27%, and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax, andCmin, respectively.
1421	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$ were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of morphine.
1422	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ was applied to the muscle in the presence of @DRUG$, both first and second contractile responses to PTX were abolished.
1423	DDI-effect	The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as @DRUG$, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by @DRUG$.
1424	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than two-fold increases of previously stable plasma levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
1425	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1426	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1427	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decrease the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
1428	DDI-effect	Alcohol: In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$.
1429	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
1430	DDI-mechanism	The oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ is reduced by 60% with coadministration of @DRUG$.
1431	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and tricyclic anti-depressants could exaggerate the prolongation of the QT interval observed with @DRUG$.
1432	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
1433	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
1434	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of heparin or @DRUG$.
1435	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.

1442	DDI-effect	Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1443	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1444	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1445	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
1446	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
1447	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
1448	DDI-effect	Although glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce PROLEUKIN-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 @DRUG$ and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension seen with @DRUG$.
1449	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1450	DDI-effect	When taken orally , @DRUG$ like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
1451	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
1452	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$ ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.

1460	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
1461	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
1462	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or inhalation general anesthetics.
1463	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
1464	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of anakinra (an @DRUG$) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
1465	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), @DRUG$.
1466	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

1468	DDI-effect	Response to @DRUG$ may be enhanced by @DRUG$.
1469	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
1470	DDI-effect	Hypertensive crises have resulted when @DRUG$ have been used concomitantly within14 days following use of @DRUG$.
1471	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and @DRUG$ can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
1472	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
1473	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1474	DDI-effect	Particular caution should be observed with @DRUG$ since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin.
1475	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
1476	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic effect of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase when @DRUG$ is given concurrently.

1478	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1479	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug @DRUG$.
1480	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the effects of other @DRUG$.
1481	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1482	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
1483	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1484	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ are given to patients receiving @DRUG$, hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crises, may occur.
1485	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, vaiproic acid, and sodium valproate.
1486	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.

1491	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1492	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1493	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1494	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
1495	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1496	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, @DRUG$, metoclopramide, pimozide.
1497	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.

1513	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and @DRUG$.
1514	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1515	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
1516	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

1523	DDI-effect	Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between @DRUG$ and enkephalins or @DRUG$.
1524	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
1525	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin and @DRUG$.
1526	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as @DRUG$ or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
1527	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
1528	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
1529	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.

1642	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1643	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
1644	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$ analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
1645	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, @DRUG$, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.

1654	DDI-effect	"Drugs that reportedly may increase oral @DRUG$ response, ie, increased prothrombin response, in man include:@DRUG$*;"
1655	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1656	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
1657	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.

1661	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
1662	DDI-effect	Digitalis: @DRUG$ may potentiate the toxic effects of @DRUG$.
1663	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1665	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
1666	DDI-advise	If additional @DRUG$ are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated.
1667	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
1668	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1669	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as @DRUG$ and metoprolol.

1671	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, @DRUG$ and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
1672	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when azathioprine and @DRUG$, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
1673	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy: Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by @DRUG$ used in methenamine therapy.
1674	DDI-advise	Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of @DRUG$ are to be administered with @DRUG$ because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
1675	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, @DRUG$.
1676	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, @DRUG$ and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
1677	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and @DRUG$ may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
1678	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
1679	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, @DRUG$, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1680	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1681	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1682	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1683	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
1684	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving @DRUG$ or amoxicillin concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
1685	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1686	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
1687	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
1688	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
1689	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
1690	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of @DRUG$ and levodopa.
1691	DDI-mechanism	"Potential for reduction in @DRUG$ and/or @DRUG$ plasma levels;"
1692	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: sertraline and @DRUG$.
1693	DDI-advise	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by carbamazepine overdose with a positive tricyclic antidepressant level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of @DRUG$ with a toxicology screen for @DRUG$.
1694	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
1695	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
1696	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or @DRUG$.
1697	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
1698	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
1699	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
1700	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
1701	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
1702	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ have been shown to reduce @DRUG$-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension seen with PROLEUKIN.
1703	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
1704	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with @DRUG$, including ibuprofen, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
1705	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
1706	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
1707	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
1708	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
1709	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
1710	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
1711	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
1712	DDI-advise	Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between TORADOL and warfarin or heparin, the administration of @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$ should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored.
1713	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
1714	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
1715	DDI-mechanism	There is a significant increase in exposure to imatinib when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (CYP3A4 inhibitor).
1716	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
1717	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, @DRUG$, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1718	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1719	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (@DRUG$, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1720	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$ (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
1721	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$.
1722	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
1723	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1724	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of @DRUG$ or pilocarpine;"
1725	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, @DRUG$, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
1726	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including @DRUG$ and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
1727	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
1728	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and related drugs may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
1729	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
1730	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
1731	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, @DRUG$, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
1732	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of @DRUG$.
1733	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1734	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1735	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
1736	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
1737	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1738	DDI-effect	Thus, smaller doses of @DRUG$ may be effective in the presence of @DRUG$.
1739	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
1740	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1741	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$  causes a decrease in the steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration.
1742	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1743	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
1744	DDI-effect	In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone.
1745	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the @DRUG$ and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1746	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain @DRUG$, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1747	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1748	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
1749	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.Cimetidine, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased altretamines half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
1750	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
1751	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
1752	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
1753	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.
1754	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
1755	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by 50%.
1756	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1757	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
1758	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when methylprednisolone was coadministered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3.
1759	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
1760	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (Desyrel) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
1761	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, @DRUG$ for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
1762	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1763	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or @DRUG$ (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
1764	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
1765	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
1766	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
1767	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
1768	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
1769	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
1770	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
1771	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with @DRUG$ and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1772	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
1773	DDI-mechanism	Saquinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with @DRUG$ resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
1774	DDI-effect	High-dose @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ protection.
1775	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1776	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
1777	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
1778	DDI-mechanism	The @DRUG$ steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to 5 1 micrograms/mL when @DRUG$ (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered.
1779	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
1780	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1781	DDI-effect	Due to their similar mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade produced by any of the @DRUG$ could be prolonged in the presence of @DRUG$.
1782	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
1783	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1784	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
1785	DDI-mechanism	Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin): Steady state plasma exposure (AUC) of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 12 days) was decreased by 27% when co-administered with multiple doses (300 mg QD for 12 days) of @DRUG$ (a CYP 3A4 inducer).
1786	DDI-advise	Based on the chemical resemblance of itraconazole and ketoconazole, coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1787	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1788	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
1789	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, @DRUG$.
1790	DDI-effect	The response to @DRUG$ may be blunted by @DRUG$ and dopamine antagonists which cause a rise in prolactin.
1791	DDI-effect	There have been reports of theophylline-related side-effects in patients on concomitant @DRUG$-@DRUG$ therapy.
1792	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
1793	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
1794	DDI-effect	Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
1795	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
1796	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (@DRUG$ such as ranitidine or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
1797	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
1798	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1799	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
1800	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, @DRUG$ (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1801	DDI-effect	Warfarin: The effects of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone.
1802	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, @DRUG$ salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
1803	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1804	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in anaesthetised horses.
1805	DDI-effect	"In the presence of @DRUG$ (10(-5) M), @DRUG$ (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;"
1806	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
1807	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
1808	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with @DRUG$ or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
1809	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), @DRUG$ such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1810	DDI-effect	ACE-inhibitors Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1811	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
1812	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1813	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1814	DDI-advise	Although this interaction has not been reported with cinoxacin, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ is given concomitantly with @DRUG$-containing products.
1815	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
1816	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
1817	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Has a synergistic effect with @DRUG$ in causing gastrointestinal bleeding.
1818	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to insulin or oral @DRUG$.
1819	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
1820	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1821	DDI-mechanism	The effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of ergotamine.
1822	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
1823	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
1824	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1825	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).
1826	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
1827	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
1828	DDI-effect	Dexamethasone and @DRUG$ similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or @DRUG$-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
1829	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
1830	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
1831	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1832	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as @DRUG$.
1833	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as @DRUG$ (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"

1837	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
1838	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as @DRUG$ or tolbutamide from their binding sites.
1839	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ excretion and the lithium may be decreased.
1840	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.

1842	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1843	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
1844	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
1845	DDI-effect	(Concurrent use with @DRUG$ may enhance the possibility of @DRUG$ toxicity associated with hypokalemia.)

1850	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: rifabutin
1851	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1852	DDI-effect	In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.
1853	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, @DRUG$, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
1854	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, @DRUG$, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.

1858	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1859	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$ and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
1860	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
1861	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.

1892	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
1893	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1894	DDI-mechanism	These alterations in @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics produced by @DRUG$ explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
1895	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
1896	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
1897	DDI-advise	@DRUG$, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
1898	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
1899	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.

1905	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, @DRUG$, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1906	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
1907	DDI-effect	This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity when @DRUG$ is withdrawn.
1908	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
1909	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
1910	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1911	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
1912	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).

1916	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
1917	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
1918	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as @DRUG$ and erythromycin with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
1919	DDI-effect	Although beta-adrenergic blockers or @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
1920	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and @DRUG$ was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"

1924	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
1925	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
1926	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or @DRUG$ (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1927	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
1928	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an @DRUG$ (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.

1935	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
1936	DDI-effect	Prior administration of @DRUG$ (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of @DRUG$ (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
1937	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.
1938	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"

1946	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
1947	DDI-effect	- The action of sulphonylureas and @DRUG$ may be enhanced by @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
1948	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or @DRUG$ may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
1949	DDI-effect	At 75% recovery of fade, hoof twitch was 87 +/- 3% for atracurium alone and 82 +/- 4% for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
1950	DDI-effect	Given the primary CNS effects of @DRUG$, caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs or @DRUG$.

1960	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose.
1961	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
1962	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.

1972	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1973	DDI-effect	Synergism was observed when @DRUG$ was combined with @DRUG$ against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella oxytoca.
1974	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
1975	DDI-effect	When other @DRUG$ or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
1976	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
1977	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
1978	DDI-mechanism	Bismuth: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$ or 60 minutes following enoxacin administration, decreased enoxacin bioavailability by approximately 25%.

1986	DDI-advise	During concomitant therapy of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
1987	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
1988	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a novel peripherally restricted opioid antagonist that may selectively prevent @DRUG$-induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia.
1989	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1990	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1991	DDI-advise	therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1992	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
1993	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, @DRUG$, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.

1996	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered with warfarin or its derivatives.
1997	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
1998	DDI-mechanism	In a single subject given one dose of @DRUG$ 2 hours after a dose of @DRUG$-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.

2125	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may not be effective due to decreased @DRUG$ concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.
2126	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2127	DDI-effect	In patients receiving @DRUG$, the addition of @DRUG$ to therapy could prolong the prothrombin time.
2128	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
2129	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
2130	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, @DRUG$, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2131	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2132	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
2133	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
2134	DDI-advise	On administration of oral @DRUG$, the need for @DRUG$ therapy should be reviewed and the dose reduced by approximately 50% or discontinued.
2135	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2136	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
2137	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2138	DDI-effect	Amantadine, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
2139	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of @DRUG$.
2140	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, @DRUG$, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
2141	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
2142	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2143	DDI-mechanism	In vitro, @DRUG$ may displace less firmly bound drugs like @DRUG$.
2144	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
2145	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
2146	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of @DRUG$ capsules (250 mg) with @DRUG$ (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.
2147	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
2148	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2149	DDI-mechanism	"A number of drugs, including @DRUG$, have been shown to displace @DRUG$ from plasma protein;"
2150	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
2151	DDI-mechanism	Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 Cimetidine: @DRUG$ inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
2152	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular @DRUG$ (50 microM) also inhibited @DRUG$-induced responses.
2153	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
2154	DDI-effect	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis.
2155	DDI-effect	Antihypertensive Medications and Vasodilators: The following adverse events were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ or @DRUG$ (n = 94) compared to patients not receiving these concomitant drugs (n = 456): hypotension 10% vs 4%, myocardial infarction 3% vs 1%, serious pneumonia 5% vs 3%, serious falls 9% vs 3%, and bone and joint injuries 6% vs 2%.
2156	DDI-effect	However, the antagonism of the @DRUG$-induced anxiogenic effects by @DRUG$ was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
2157	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
2158	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite.
2159	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
2160	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2161	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), @DRUG$ containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2162	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), @DRUG$ (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2163	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2164	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
2165	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2166	DDI-effect	The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.
2167	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, @DRUG$, or thiazolesulfone.
2168	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2169	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
2170	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem and @DRUG$ with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
2171	DDI-effect	Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently.
2172	DDI-effect	Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when @DRUG$ infection and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly.
2173	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2174	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2175	DDI-effect	As with some other @DRUG$, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by NUROMAX is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
2176	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine - @DRUG$ may counteract the antinaturetic effect of @DRUG$.
2177	DDI-effect	Furosemide: @DRUG$ IV/IM reduced the diuretic response to @DRUG$ in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20% (mean sodium and urinary output decreased 17%).
2178	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
2179	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
2180	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (@DRUG$, thiothixene, alprazolam).
2181	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2182	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ used concurrently increases the risk of renal calculus formation.
2183	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or @DRUG$) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
2184	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
2185	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
2186	DDI-effect	Because @DRUG$ may enhance the serotonergic effects of @DRUG$, caution should be exercised when LEXAPRO and lithium are coadministered.
2187	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Aprepitant, when given as a regimen of 125mg with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and @DRUG$ when given as 80 mg/day with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
2188	DDI-advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for @DRUG$ (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with @DRUG$ coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
2189	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, @DRUG$, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2190	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
2191	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2192	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
2193	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents.
2194	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
2195	DDI-mechanism	Ephedrine: @DRUG$ may enhance the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
2196	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2197	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ and other sedatives
2198	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2199	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
2200	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
2201	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
2202	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2203	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
2204	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2205	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
2206	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
2207	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
2208	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
2209	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2210	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
2211	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, @DRUG$(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2212	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
2213	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2214	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID (day 1) and 40 mg QD (days 2-7)) with @DRUG$ (10 mg glyburide BID) resulted in 21% increase in glyburide AUC0-12 and a 16% increase in glyburide Cmax leading to a 16% decrease in glucose AUC0-24.
2215	DDI-effect	Digitalis: @DRUG$ may potentiate the toxic effects of @DRUG$.
2216	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2217	DDI-effect	The prior administration of @DRUG$ does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$.
2218	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
2219	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
2220	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
2221	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a @DRUG$ (SSRI) and @DRUG$.
2222	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: @DRUG$, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide.
2223	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, @DRUG$, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2224	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2225	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2226	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril or @DRUG$ can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.
2227	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2228	DDI-advise	- @DRUG$ or MAO-inhibitors (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
2229	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, @DRUG$, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
2230	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of nitrofurantoin is not recommended since @DRUG$ may antagonize the antibacterial effect of @DRUG$ in the urinary tract.
2231	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
2232	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2233	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2234	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
2235	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, @DRUG$) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2236	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (600 mg b.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 13-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax.
2237	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
2238	DDI-effect	Vaccines: Patients on @DRUG$ therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and @DRUG$ due to inhibition of antibody response.
2239	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2240	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing @DRUG$, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2241	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
2242	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ along with either oral or intravenous @DRUG$ should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension.
2243	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2244	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
2245	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2246	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
2247	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
2248	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
2249	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, @DRUG$, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
2250	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2251	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
2252	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2253	DDI-effect	This may indicate that @DRUG$ could enhance the toxicity of @DRUG$.
2254	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ treatment should be closely monitored when @DRUG$ is introduced or withdrawn.
2255	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of @DRUG$, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
2256	DDI-effect	Interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos.
2257	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2258	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
2259	DDI-mechanism	In vitro, @DRUG$ may displace less firmly bound drugs like @DRUG$.
2260	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2261	DDI-mechanism	Colchicine @DRUG$ and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
2262	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
2263	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2264	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
2265	DDI-effect	In common with other @DRUG$, AUGMENTIN XR may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$
2266	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedatives.
2267	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of @DRUG$ to subjects receiving multiple doses of @DRUG$, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone.
2268	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when azathioprine and @DRUG$, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
2269	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir and indinavir: Upon concomitant administration of 5 mg of @DRUG$ with 600 mg BID @DRUG$, the Cmax and AUC of ritonavir were reduced by approximately 20%.
2270	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and @DRUG$."
2271	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other @DRUG$, concomitant administration of Ponstel and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
2272	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2273	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
2274	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a novel peripherally restricted opioid antagonist that may selectively prevent @DRUG$-induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia.
2275	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ 600 mg daily, a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism, produced an approximate 50% decrease in rofecoxib plasma concentrations.
2276	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$.
2277	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2278	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2279	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), @DRUG$, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2280	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
2281	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
2282	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ and antihypertensive agents.
2283	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of naloxone at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin, and a high dose of @DRUG$ (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ (16 micrograms).
2284	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2285	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other @DRUG$) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2286	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
2287	DDI-mechanism	HIV Protease Inhibitors: @DRUG$ (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life.
2288	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other @DRUG$, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
2289	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2290	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2291	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2292	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
2293	DDI-effect	The use of MAO inhibitors or @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.
2294	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
2295	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2296	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2297	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
2298	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
2299	DDI-mechanism	During administration of multiple oral doses of @DRUG$ to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of @DRUG$, a 13%-19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.
2300	DDI-effect	However, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of CELEBREX alone.
2301	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2302	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
2303	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2304	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., @DRUG$), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2305	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: A study in 6 healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a 1 week course of @DRUG$ at 1000 mg per day and @DRUG$ at 40 mg per day.
2306	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2307	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
2308	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
2309	DDI-effect	Olanzapine: Coadministration of @DRUG$ 3 mg and @DRUG$ 10 mg produced a decrease in DSST scores.
2310	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2311	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: @DRUG$ enhances the effect of warfarin.
2312	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease vascular response to pressor drugs such as @DRUG$.
2313	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2314	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
2315	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2316	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that ketoconazole or @DRUG$ co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
2317	DDI-effect	Norepinephrine: @DRUG$ enhance the adrenergic effect of @DRUG$.
2318	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$.
2319	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
2320	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve.
2321	DDI-effect	Two percent of patients treated concurrently with @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
2322	DDI-advise	These @DRUG$ should be used in the myasthenic patient only where definitely indicated, and then careful adjustment should be made of adjunctive @DRUG$ dosage.
2323	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2324	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
2325	DDI-effect	In a similar study with tamsulosin in healthy volunteers, 1 of 24 subjects dosed with @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 0.4 mg separated by 6 hours experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg.
2326	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
2327	DDI-effect	The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
2328	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2329	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants, most notably @DRUG$, and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is reduced by concomitant administration of N 2O.
2330	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
2331	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
2332	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, @DRUG$, theophylline, vitamin D.
2333	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and @DRUG$ (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2334	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2335	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: Reports indicate that @DRUG$ levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ for injection.
2336	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2337	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
2338	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating @DRUG$ such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.
2339	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;@DRUG$;and quinidine."
2340	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2341	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
2342	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2343	DDI-effect	Combined treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation.
2344	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, @DRUG$ and itraconazole) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
2345	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
2346	DDI-effect	Co-administration: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, thrombolytics, and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.
2347	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2348	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as @DRUG$ or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2349	DDI-mechanism	ERYTHROMYCIN: In hypercholesterolemic patients, steady-state @DRUG$ AUC and Cmax increased approximately 50% and 24% respectively after 10 days with co-administration of @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
2350	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other @DRUG$ while taking digoxin, methotrexate, or @DRUG$ may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
2351	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2352	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
2353	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
2354	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
2355	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain @DRUG$, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2356	DDI-effect	Inhibitors Of Endogenous Prostaglandin Synthesis It has been reported that @DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$, especially in cases of low renin hypertension.
2357	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2358	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
2359	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
2360	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
2361	DDI-mechanism	Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol) may be increased when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used in combination.
2362	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with succinylcholine or with other @DRUG$.
2363	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
2364	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
2365	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
2366	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates and other sedatives
2367	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
2368	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2369	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (@DRUG$, oxazepam, temazepam).
2370	DDI-effect	Hyperpyrexia has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
2371	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), @DRUG$ (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2372	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
2373	DDI-effect	It would be expected that @DRUG$ use during therapy with @DRUG$ would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.
2374	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
2375	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
2376	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
2377	DDI-effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms (severe dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ is added to the drug regimen.
2378	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
2379	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the plasma levels of @DRUG$, if given concomitantly.
2380	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a @DRUG$ and a calcium channel blocker.
2381	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2382	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
2383	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, methyldopa and @DRUG$.
2384	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and @DRUG$-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2385	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2386	DDI-effect	However, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (5-7.5 mg initial oral dose followed by 2.5-6 mg/day orally for 6-10 days) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR).
2387	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$, or metoclopramide.
2388	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
2389	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ should receive 70 mg of @DRUG$ daily.
2390	DDI-effect	Benazepril, like other @DRUG$, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
2391	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.
2392	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2393	DDI-mechanism	Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.
2394	DDI-effect	- The action of @DRUG$ and insulin may be enhanced by Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2395	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2396	DDI-mechanism	Fluconazole: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ at 200 mg QD resulted in a two-fold increase in @DRUG$ plasma concentration.
2397	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2398	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including @DRUG$) has additive depressant effects.
2399	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2400	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, quinine, quinidine and @DRUG$) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.
2401	DDI-mechanism	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the rate of elimination of @DRUG$ (by approximately 50%) by the same mechanism.
2402	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators.
2403	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, @DRUG$, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2404	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives.
2405	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of @DRUG$ increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.
2406	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
2407	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ could exaggerate the depression of AV nodal conduction observed with @DRUG$.
2408	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2409	DDI-mechanism	Inducers and Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism: @DRUG$ reduced plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ by about 70%.
2410	DDI-effect	Hypertensive crises have resulted when @DRUG$ have been used concomitantly within14 days following use of @DRUG$.
2411	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with @DRUG$, including ibuprofen, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
2412	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
2413	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, @DRUG$, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
2414	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
2415	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
2416	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
2417	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2418	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
2419	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2420	DDI-effect	In post-marketing experience, bleeding events have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$.
2421	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
2422	DDI-effect	Cyclopropane or @DRUG$ increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as @DRUG$.
2423	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2424	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Diclofenac and other @DRUG$ can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
2425	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2426	DDI-advise	- @DRUG$ or MAO-inhibitors (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2427	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
2428	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines (e.g., @DRUG$ or diazepam) are additive.
2429	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2430	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given @DRUG$.
2431	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2432	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
2433	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2434	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
2435	DDI-advise	SUBUTEX and @DRUG$ should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
2436	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are reduced when given concurrently with @DRUG$.
2437	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, procaine, or @DRUG$.
2438	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2439	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2440	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other @DRUG$ while taking digoxin, @DRUG$, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
2441	DDI-advise	Other 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of treatment with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2442	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
2443	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other @DRUG$, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2444	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduced the blood AUC0-12 of @DRUG$ by approximately 20%, peak blood concentration (Cmax) by 16%, and 12-hour blood concentration (C12hr) by 26% in healthy subjects when tacrolimus (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart) was administered on the 10th day of CANCIDAS 70 mg daily, as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone.
2445	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2446	DDI-effect	Clinically significant effects have been reported with the @DRUG$ when used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2447	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
2448	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2449	DDI-effect	Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy.
2450	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2451	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may result in an increased risk of GI ulceration and complications compared to valdecoxib alone.
2452	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2453	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2454	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
2455	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2456	DDI-effect	Antidiabetics: Because @DRUG$ may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of @DRUG$ may be required.
2457	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
2458	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2459	DDI-mechanism	"Although no studies have been conducted, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of phenytoin;"
2460	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of carbachol or @DRUG$;"
2461	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
2462	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or @DRUG$ (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2463	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that @DRUG$ like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
2464	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
2465	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, @DRUG$ or codeine.
2466	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, @DRUG$, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2467	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
2468	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, @DRUG$, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2469	DDI-effect	Digitalis glycosides: @DRUG$-induced hypokalemia may potentiate @DRUG$ toxicity.
2470	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, @DRUG$, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2471	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2472	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
2473	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, @DRUG$, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2474	DDI-effect	Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: @DRUG$ can attenuate potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
2475	DDI-effect	(@DRUG$ may increase the responsiveness to @DRUG$.)
2476	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
2477	DDI-effect	Edema has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2478	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
2479	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or @DRUG$ (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2480	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, @DRUG$, may decrease the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2481	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and @DRUG$) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2482	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2483	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of @DRUG$ and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
2484	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2485	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2486	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
2487	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
2488	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
2489	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be coadministered.
2490	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
2491	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other members of the @DRUG$.
2492	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and @DRUG$, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
2493	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2494	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2495	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
2496	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2497	DDI-effect	Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ and the @DRUG$.
2498	DDI-mechanism	Mineral Oil-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2499	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2500	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2501	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and @DRUG$;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2502	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
2503	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
2504	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients taking @DRUG$, because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
2505	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, @DRUG$, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2506	DDI-advise	Theophylline serum levels should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments considered for patients given both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2507	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
2508	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
2509	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, @DRUG$, iron salts and digoxin).
2510	DDI-advise	Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.
2511	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2512	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2513	DDI-effect	In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$
2514	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2515	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2516	DDI-advise	If these agents are to be administered concurrently, @DRUG$ concentrations should be monitored, especially when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.
2517	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
2518	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
2519	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of delavirdine (20%) and @DRUG$ (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
2520	DDI-mechanism	A study in eight healthy volunteers has shown a 50% increase in mean peak nimodipine plasma concentrations and a 90% increase in mean area under the curve, after a one week course of @DRUG$ at 1,000 mg/day and @DRUG$ at 90 mg/day.
2521	DDI-effect	When other antiplatelet agents or @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
2522	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
2523	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
2524	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of R-warfarin and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of @DRUG$.
2525	DDI-mechanism	This effect may be mediated by the ability of @DRUG$ to induce microsomal enzymes and, thus, the catabolism of @DRUG$.
2526	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving @DRUG$, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary.
2527	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2528	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing @DRUG$ or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2529	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
2530	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
2531	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
2532	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (@DRUG$, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2533	DDI-effect	The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
2534	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, @DRUG$ inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
2535	DDI-advise	Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of @DRUG$ while under treatment with @DRUG$ or SUBUTEX.
2536	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ritonavir, and @DRUG$) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2537	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2538	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2539	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2540	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
2541	DDI-advise	Patients who are applying @DRUG$ gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET (N, @DRUG$), a common component of insect repellent products.
2542	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2543	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2544	DDI-effect	There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ were used concomitantly.
2545	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of @DRUG$ in both dietary cobalt treatments.
2546	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2547	DDI-effect	In both species, @DRUG$, but not (+)-NANM, antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of @DRUG$ on FI and FR responding.
2548	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular @DRUG$ (50 microM) also inhibited @DRUG$-induced responses.
2549	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
2550	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2551	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), @DRUG$, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2552	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of HEXALEN and antidepressants of the MAO inhibitor class may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.@DRUG$, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased @DRUG$s half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
2553	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (@DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
2554	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ modifies @DRUG$ metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin.
2555	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
2556	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and @DRUG$ may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2557	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
2558	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2559	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ in patients who are receiving @DRUG$ may potentiate renal disease states.
2560	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2561	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, @DRUG$, anesthetics) should be considered.
2562	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
2563	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
2564	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of @DRUG$ to subjects receiving multiple doses of @DRUG$, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone.
2565	DDI-mechanism	Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when @DRUG$ was given with @DRUG$.
2566	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of @DRUG$ elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of Betaseron on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown.
2567	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2568	DDI-mechanism	Antidepressants: In vitro data indicate that @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2569	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
2570	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decrease the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
2571	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2572	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2573	DDI-advise	Microdosed minipill @DRUG$ preparations are not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
2574	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the activity of other @DRUG$.

2576	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of @DRUG$.
2577	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
2578	DDI-mechanism	Treatment with @DRUG$ once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy subjects was associated with an inhibition of P450 1A2 and a 25% increase in @DRUG$ AUC.
2579	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as @DRUG$ (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2580	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other @DRUG$, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2581	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
2582	DDI-effect	Methotrexate - There is one report that @DRUG$ may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental @DRUG$ for chemotherapy-induced mucositis.
2583	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with @DRUG$ (10 mg/kg/day) (n=7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n=12).
2584	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
2585	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2586	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
2587	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2588	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other @DRUG$, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
2589	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, if @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in digoxin levels.
2590	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with Bezalip or @DRUG$ retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
2591	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2592	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these @DRUG$.
2593	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2594	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
2595	DDI-mechanism	Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of @DRUG$ and digitoxin.
2596	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and nitrite in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that @DRUG$ may react with @DRUG$ in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
2597	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
2598	DDI-effect	In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, prothrombin time (measured as INR) was increased by approximately 8% to 11%.
2599	DDI-effect	When other potent parental @DRUG$, such as @DRUG$, are used in combination with hydralazine, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure.
2600	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with allopurinol (100 mg/kg, ip) or @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
2601	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
2602	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
2603	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2604	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
2605	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
2606	DDI-mechanism	"Cyclosporine: Combination @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations;"
2607	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
2608	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as @DRUG$) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2609	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (@DRUG$, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2610	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2611	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as @DRUG$, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2612	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other @DRUG$.
2613	DDI-advise	Because a similar interaction is likely, @DRUG$ should also not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
2614	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, @DRUG$ resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2615	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2616	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2617	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and @DRUG$, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2618	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or @DRUG$.
2619	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of @DRUG$, barbiturates or other sedating drugs.
2620	DDI-advise	"Patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored;"
2621	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
2622	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2623	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: @DRUG$, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2624	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of loperamide and partly antagonized the effect of @DRUG$.
2625	DDI-effect	Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects an blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2626	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2627	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: May decrease renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
2628	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
2629	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other @DRUG$, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
2630	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2631	DDI-advise	This time window is different than for other oral formulations of @DRUG$, which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after @DRUG$.
2632	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates or other sedatives.
2633	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ or calcium channel blockers and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
2634	DDI-effect	The blood pressure effect of @DRUG$ tended to be greater in patients on @DRUG$ than in patients on no other antihypertensive therapy.
2635	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
2636	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2637	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral @DRUG$, warfarin, or its derivatives.
2638	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
2639	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
2640	DDI-mechanism	Milk, milk products, and @DRUG$-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of @DRUG$.
2641	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2642	DDI-mechanism	In a single subject given one dose of @DRUG$ 2 hours after a dose of @DRUG$-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.
2643	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2644	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.

2646	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2647	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2648	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2649	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
2650	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2651	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
2652	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$ careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.
2653	DDI-effect	The vasodilating effects of @DRUG$ may be additive with those of other @DRUG$.
2654	DDI-effect	ACE-inhibitors:Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
2655	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2656	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
2657	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., @DRUG$, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2658	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and @DRUG$, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2659	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
2660	DDI-effect	Particular caution is necessary when using @DRUG$ in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (especially @DRUG$) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effect by flumazenil.
2661	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
2662	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, @DRUG$, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2664	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2665	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2666	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium/aluminum-containing @DRUG$.
2667	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.

2669	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.
2670	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and @DRUG$.
2671	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that disulfiram may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
2672	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
2673	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
2674	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other @DRUG$ such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2675	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2676	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, @DRUG$ Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
2677	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with injectable @DRUG$, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2678	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, @DRUG$, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2679	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2680	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2681	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2682	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2683	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2684	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2685	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), @DRUG$ (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2686	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ containing magnesium or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2687	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
2688	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2689	DDI-effect	Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when @DRUG$ was administered to rats treated with @DRUG$ 8 hours before the ethanol challenge.
2690	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ are reported to fluctuate significantly when @DRUG$ is either added or deleted from the drug regimen.

2692	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
2693	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2694	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$;"
2695	DDI-effect	Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$, and it is possible that the administration of @DRUG$ as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
2696	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of @DRUG$.
2697	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other @DRUG$.
2698	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2699	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
2700	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.

2702	DDI-mechanism	This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.
2703	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2704	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in @DRUG$ levels with @DRUG$ co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
2705	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either @DRUG$, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or codeine.
2706	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.

2708	DDI-effect	Recovery of hoof twitch from 50% to 75% took 7.7 +/- 0.7 min for atracurium alone and 11.5 +/- 2.7 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ (P = 0.03).
2709	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, @DRUG$, and other CNS depressants.
2710	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
2711	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, @DRUG$ and nefazadone) .
2712	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
2713	DDI-mechanism	In addition, other @DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of @DRUG$.
2714	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as @DRUG$ and atorvastatin.
2715	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
2716	DDI-mechanism	Single doses of either @DRUG$ or colestipol resins bind the @DRUG$ and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
2717	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other @DRUG$, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
2718	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
2719	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2720	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or @DRUG$) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
2721	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2722	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2723	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, @DRUG$, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2724	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2725	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, @DRUG$, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2726	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
2727	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., @DRUG$) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
2728	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
2729	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ may potentiate @DRUG$-induced neuromuscular block.
2730	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
2731	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
2732	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$-containing minipill preparations.
2733	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
2734	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other @DRUG$ and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).
2735	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in @DRUG$metabolism.
2736	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with @DRUG$ and lithium.
2737	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
2738	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2739	DDI-mechanism	Withdrawal of @DRUG$ decreased the @DRUG$ requirement by 50%.
2740	DDI-mechanism	Extended Release Tablets: Administration of nifedipine with @DRUG$ increased @DRUG$ levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers.
2741	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
2742	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
2743	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;@DRUG$;and quinidine."
2744	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or @DRUG$.
2745	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, @DRUG$, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2746	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
2747	DDI-effect	Taking a @DRUG$ while you are taking or within 2 weeks of taking @DRUG$ may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction.
2748	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, etc).
2749	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as @DRUG$, barbiturates, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
2750	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
2751	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
2752	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
2753	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2754	DDI-effect	Ketamine: Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported in association with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2755	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of @DRUG$ (vitamin C) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
2756	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving @DRUG$, procaine, or thiazolesulfone.
2757	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.

2759	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, @DRUG$ (AVONEX  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
2760	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.

2763	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2764	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that @DRUG$, itraconazole, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2765	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, @DRUG$, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
2766	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
2767	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2768	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and enalapril IV is augmented by @DRUG$ that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).

2771	DDI-mechanism	The steady state plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day.
2772	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$ and magnesium hydroxide reduce the oral absorption of @DRUG$ by 75%.
2773	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2774	DDI-effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ but may be seen after several months.
2775	DDI-effect	It is concluded that @DRUG$ is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with @DRUG$ would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system.

2790	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using @DRUG$ or digitalis concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2791	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/@DRUG$, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
2792	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2793	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
2794	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: @DRUG$ increases the effect of @DRUG$

2798	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied
2799	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.

2801	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2802	DDI-advise	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
2803	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2804	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;@DRUG$;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2805	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
2806	DDI-effect	However, another @DRUG$ has been found to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of @DRUG$.

2810	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (@DRUG$) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2811	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using @DRUG$ or digitalis concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2812	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, @DRUG$, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.

2890	DDI-effect	Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose (4 mg/kg/day) @DRUG$ group were supersensitive to @DRUG$ compared to the vehicle or low-dose (10 microg/kg/day) estradiol groups (pD2 values = 7.86+/-0.09, 7.30+/-0.11 and 7.35+/-0.04, respectively).
2891	DDI-mechanism	The @DRUG$ steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to 5 1 micrograms/mL when @DRUG$ (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered.
2892	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
2893	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ have been reported to competitively inhibit @DRUG$ accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.
2894	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
2895	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
2896	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in @DRUG$ therapy.
2897	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2898	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2899	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
2900	DDI-effect	Antagonism has been demonstrated between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
2901	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2902	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
2903	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, @DRUG$, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
2904	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, @DRUG$, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2905	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
2906	DDI-mechanism	Hydrochlorothiazide: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide.
2907	DDI-int	A two-way interaction between the @DRUG$, phenytoin, and the @DRUG$s has been suggested.
2908	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing @DRUG$ or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
2909	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: In controlled studies in healthy volunteers, @DRUG$ either had no effect (one study) or was associated with modest increases, about 30% (two studies) in steady-state serum @DRUG$ concentrations.
2910	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
2911	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ may reduce plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2912	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
2913	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
2914	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2915	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
2916	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including nalidixic acid, may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2917	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2918	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, @DRUG$, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2919	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
2920	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
2921	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
2922	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
2923	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
2924	DDI-mechanism	However, @DRUG$ anesthetic requirement (i.e., MAC) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56% 1-2 hours and as much as 14% 5-6 hours after injection of @DRUG$, 50 mg/kg, im.
2925	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and @DRUG$.
2926	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the @DRUG$ and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
2927	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2928	DDI-advise	Thus, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided.
2929	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of @DRUG$ was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days.
2930	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
2931	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
2932	DDI-effect	only @DRUG$ enhances @DRUG$-induced increases in accumbal dopamine.
2933	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2934	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2935	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
2936	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: @DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125mg with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and Aprepitant when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
2937	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2938	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
2939	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2940	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, @DRUG$ or some antihistamines.
2941	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were administered concomitantly.
2942	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by @DRUG$, such as propranolol and metoprolol.
2943	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2944	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of @DRUG$ and azathioprine to 6-thiouric acid.
2945	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2946	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
2947	DDI-advise	Patients who are applying @DRUG$ gel should not concurrently use products that contain @DRUG$ (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products.
2948	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
2949	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2950	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2951	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2952	DDI-effect	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of @DRUG$.
2953	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
2954	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
2955	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase sensitivity to the @DRUG$.
2956	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2957	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
2958	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
2959	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.
2960	DDI-effect	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2961	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2962	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2963	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, @DRUG$ and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
2964	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), @DRUG$ and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2965	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2966	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (Ultram).
2967	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute @DRUG$ intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2968	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2969	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, @DRUG$ and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
2970	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients who are receiving @DRUG$ or monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs may result in an additive pressor effect .
2971	DDI-mechanism	Clofibric acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
2972	DDI-mechanism	or with multivitamins containing @DRUG$ may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue @DRUG$ concentrations.
2973	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, @DRUG$, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2974	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that @DRUG$, erythromycin, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2975	DDI-mechanism	Based on total @DRUG$ concentrations, @DRUG$ increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
2976	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
2977	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten C max by 23% and @DRUG$ AUC by 16%.
2978	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
2979	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
2980	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
2981	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
2982	DDI-effect	Vaccines: Patients on @DRUG$ therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or @DRUG$ due to inhibition of antibody response.
2983	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, @DRUG$, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2984	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
2985	DDI-effect	Sildenafil citrate - Theoretically, @DRUG$ supplements taken concomitantly with @DRUG$, may potentiate the effects of the drug.
2986	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2987	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2988	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2989	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthines, or metoclopramide.
2990	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, @DRUG$, vitamin D.
2991	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2992	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2993	DDI-effect	Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a @DRUG$.
2994	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
2995	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, @DRUG$, alprazolam).
2996	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, @DRUG$, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2997	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2998	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
2999	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
3000	DDI-effect	Sildenafil citrate - Theoretically, @DRUG$ supplements taken concomitantly with @DRUG$, may potentiate the effects of the drug.
3001	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3002	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ should be administered (with food) one hour after or more than two hours before @DRUG$.
3003	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, @DRUG$, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
3004	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including @DRUG$, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
3005	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
3006	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3007	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
3008	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3009	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
3010	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
3011	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: @DRUG$  is not recommended for use in patients who have received @DRUG$ within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics
3012	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
3013	DDI-effect	Interactions for Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Antihypertensive Therapy: @DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$ and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension.
3014	DDI-effect	In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg daily of @DRUG$ with the ACE inhibitor @DRUG$, 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks, was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to ACE inhibitor alone.
3015	DDI-mechanism	Repeated doses of @DRUG$ given prior to a single dose of @DRUG$ in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption.
3016	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
3017	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of @DRUG$, especially in the presence of impaired renal function.
3018	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3019	DDI-mechanism	"There was a small decrease in the clearance of @DRUG$ caused by a 400-mg dose of @DRUG$;"
3020	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
3021	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3022	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with benzodiazepines or @DRUG$.
3023	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
3024	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
3025	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3026	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ 30 mg and @DRUG$, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.
3027	DDI-mechanism	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because @DRUG$ increases the rate of excretion of @DRUG$, the concomitant use of Nalfon and salicylates is not recommended.
3028	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a 42% to 74% dose-related decrease in theophylline clearance and a subsequent 260% to 350% increase in serum theophylline levels.
3029	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
3030	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3031	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
3032	DDI-effect	Alpha-blockers: When @DRUG$ 10 or 20 mg was given to healthy volunteers either simultaneously or 6 hours after a 10 mg dose of @DRUG$, significant hypotension developed in a substantial number of subjects.
3033	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3034	DDI-advise	During concomitant therapy of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
3035	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3036	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, nicotine, and @DRUG$ may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3037	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3038	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3039	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or @DRUG$-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
3040	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ and norepinephrine.
3041	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
3042	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ during therapy with @DRUG$.
3043	DDI-advise	Therefore, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-like drugs simultaneously.
3044	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with midazolam or @DRUG$ has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
3045	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and @DRUG$.
3046	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$ and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
3047	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, @DRUG$, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3048	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with @DRUG$ (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.
3049	DDI-effect	In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3050	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3051	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3052	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3053	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3054	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3055	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, @DRUG$, trazodone
3056	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3057	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
3058	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3059	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$.
3060	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3061	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3062	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3063	DDI-effect	However, high doses of @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered @DRUG$.
3064	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
3065	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3066	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and @DRUG$.
3067	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
3068	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
3069	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3070	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3071	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
3072	DDI-effect	Iodine or iodine excess may decrease the effect of Carbimazole, and an @DRUG$ deficiency can increase the effect of @DRUG$.
3073	DDI-effect	Patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
3074	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents.
3075	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
3076	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, @DRUG$, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
3077	DDI-mechanism	Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and Lodine  (@DRUG$ capsules and tablets) results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin.
3078	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, barbiturates, and @DRUG$ may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
3079	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3080	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 152% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and very little change in ritonavir plasma A.C.
3081	DDI-effect	Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high-@DRUG$ rats were supersensitive to @DRUG$ when compared to vehicle-, progesterone- and progesterone + high-estradiol-treated rats (pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12, 7.21+/-0.13, 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18, respectively).
3082	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with @DRUG$ or fluoxetine, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
3083	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, @DRUG$), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3084	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3085	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
3086	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3087	DDI-effect	There is thus an enhancement effect of @DRUG$ upon the reaction of placental vessels to @DRUG$ in vitro.
3088	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ inhibited the @DRUG$-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase due to release from the Ca(2+) store.
3089	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3090	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, @DRUG$, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3091	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
3092	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
3093	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates, alcohol, and other CNS depressants.
3094	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3095	DDI-mechanism	In vitro data suggest that @DRUG$, when compared to ketoconazole, has a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3096	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
3097	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
3098	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
3099	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3100	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
3101	DDI-effect	Other @DRUG$ that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis have been shown to interfere with @DRUG$ in some studies and with potassium-sparing diuretics.
3102	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3103	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or @DRUG$ and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
3104	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, tranquilizers, and @DRUG$.
3105	DDI-int	Thus, the interaction observed between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not expected for dirithromycin.
3106	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
3107	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3108	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
3109	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3110	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of @DRUG$ (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
3111	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and @DRUG$) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
3112	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3113	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3114	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3115	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3116	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3117	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a neutralizing agent for @DRUG$ that protects against renal damage.
3118	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
3119	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, opiates, and alcohol.
3120	DDI-effect	The successive application of @DRUG$ (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
3121	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
3122	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), @DRUG$, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3123	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (@DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3124	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like @DRUG$ or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3125	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3126	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3127	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3128	DDI-effect	Diuretics: @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
3129	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
3130	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
3131	DDI-effect	We conclude that @DRUG$ prevents @DRUG$-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
3132	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
3133	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
3134	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3135	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
3136	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3137	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3138	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
3139	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
3140	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either azithromycin or @DRUG$.
3141	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous @DRUG$, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3142	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, @DRUG$ Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3143	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that flurbiprofen like other @DRUG$, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
3144	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3145	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3146	DDI-mechanism	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$.
3147	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
3148	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and @DRUG$.
3149	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and @DRUG$ may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3150	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
3151	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
3152	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$).
3153	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3154	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
3155	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
3156	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3157	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3158	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3159	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3160	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3161	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
3162	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
3163	DDI-mechanism	In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving @DRUG$ or digoxin in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
3164	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
3165	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3166	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and @DRUG$ such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3167	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3168	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
3169	DDI-effect	When other potent parental @DRUG$, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with @DRUG$, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure.
3170	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as @DRUG$, barbiturates, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
3171	DDI-effect	Exogenous @DRUG$ also appeared to influence the percentage of @DRUG$-induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner.
3172	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, @DRUG$, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
3173	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$ therapy
3174	DDI-effect	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of @DRUG$.
3175	DDI-effect	Veratrum alkaloids: @DRUG$ inhibit the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
3176	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
3177	DDI-effect	An additive hypotensive effect has been reported with the combination of systemic @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy.
3178	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3179	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3180	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3181	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with @DRUG$ overdosage or in those taking methotrexate.
3182	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, @DRUG$, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3183	DDI-effect	1- adrenergic receptor antagonism, @DRUG$ has the potential to enhance the effect of certain @DRUG$.
3184	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
3185	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
3186	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of @DRUG$ or warfarin.
3187	DDI-mechanism	Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
3188	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
3189	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, @DRUG$, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3190	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ are given to patients receiving @DRUG$, hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crises, may occur.
3191	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any @DRUG$, including Solganal and Myochrysine.
3192	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ - @DRUG$ may potentiate the tardive dyskinesia side reactions of neuroleptic drugs if used concomitantly with them.
3193	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$ or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
3194	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3195	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3196	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose @DRUG$ coadministration leads to higher @DRUG$ exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus.
3197	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3198	DDI-mechanism	Diltiazem: In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of @DRUG$ once daily, as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation, with @DRUG$ 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2-fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of diltiazem AUC.
3199	DDI-mechanism	The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$, a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9.
3200	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
3201	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).
3202	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was coadministered with phenytoin, @DRUG$, or H2antagonists, reduced plasma concentrations of itraconazole were reported.
3203	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
3204	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
3205	DDI-advise	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made.
3206	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3207	DDI-int	conversely, @DRUG$ may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (i.e., @DRUG$, a-methyldopa).
3208	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of @DRUG$ (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
3209	DDI-effect	Both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ slow AV conduction.
3210	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3211	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
3212	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3213	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
3214	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
3215	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, @DRUG$, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3216	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3217	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants, including @DRUG$, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
3218	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
3219	DDI-advise	Consequently, the combination of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is also contraindicated.
3220	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
3221	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
3222	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
3223	DDI-effect	In a small (n=30) combination study of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients.
3224	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, @DRUG$, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3225	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3226	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
3227	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of @DRUG$ and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3228	DDI-effect	Due to their similar mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade produced by any of the @DRUG$ could be prolonged in the presence of @DRUG$.
3229	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
3230	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3231	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
3232	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3233	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3234	DDI-effect	Studies in rats have shown that @DRUG$ administration attenuates certain types of adrenocortical steroid dependent hypertension, including @DRUG$ hypertension.
3235	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3236	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., @DRUG$).
3237	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with ENBREL  alone (0%).
3238	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
3239	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3240	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
3241	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
3242	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
3243	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3244	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
3245	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
3246	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other @DRUG$ have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
3247	DDI-effect	Clinically significant effects have been reported with the @DRUG$ when used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3248	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and @DRUG$, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3249	DDI-mechanism	Studies in humans show that the absorption of @DRUG$ as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before @DRUG$.
3250	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), @DRUG$ and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3251	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, @DRUG$, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3252	DDI-mechanism	The coadministration of @DRUG$ decreases the biologic half-life of @DRUG$ because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine.
3253	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
3254	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), @DRUG$ such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3255	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3256	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
3257	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
3258	DDI-effect	However, there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when @DRUG$ was added to the regimen of a patient treated with @DRUG$.
3259	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3260	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
3261	DDI-mechanism	In two clinical studies, @DRUG$ (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by approximately 35%.
3262	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, @DRUG$, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3263	DDI-effect	Warfarin-@DRUG$ can antagonize the effect of @DRUG$
3264	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (@DRUG$)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3265	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ increases both free and bound @DRUG$ by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
3266	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
3267	DDI-effect	However, the antagonism of the @DRUG$-induced anxiogenic effects by @DRUG$ was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
3268	DDI-mechanism	After the coadministration of 200 mg oral @DRUG$ twice daily and one 20 mg dose of @DRUG$ to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (  142 S.D.) and 251% (  68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo.
3269	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3270	DDI-effect	Since @DRUG$ inhibits platelet function, there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients maintained on @DRUG$.
3271	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3272	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3273	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants: There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ were used concomitantly.
3274	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3275	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3276	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3277	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of @DRUG$.
3278	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, @DRUG$, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3279	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
3280	DDI-effect	In both species, @DRUG$, but not (+)-NANM, antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of @DRUG$ on FI and FR responding.
3281	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, @DRUG$ and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3282	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and @DRUG$.
3283	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3284	DDI-effect	Coingestion of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
3285	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3286	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
3287	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
3288	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3289	DDI-effect	Non-selective MAO inhibitors including tranylcypromine sulfate, phenelzine sulfate, and pargyline HC1: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and non-selective @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
3290	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
3291	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with @DRUG$ or enalaprilat can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.
3292	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, @DRUG$, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3293	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants: There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ were used concomitantly.
3294	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
3295	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3296	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, @DRUG$), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3297	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), @DRUG$ (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3298	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
3299	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
3300	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3301	DDI-advise	Although a 3-day regimen of @DRUG$ given concomitantly with oral @DRUG$ has not been studied, alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used.
3302	DDI-effect	Alcohol: In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$.
3303	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and @DRUG$ may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
3304	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may block the antihypertensive action of @DRUG$ and similarly acting compounds.
3305	DDI-effect	Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with @DRUG$, to which @DRUG$ was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either ENBREL CI or sulfasalazine alone.
3306	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
3307	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, @DRUG$, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
3308	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3309	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3310	DDI-effect	"May interact with the following: cholestyramine, @DRUG$ (use with @DRUG$ may prevent the diuretic from working properly;"
3311	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
3312	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3313	DDI-effect	Additionally, @DRUG$, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
3314	DDI-mechanism	In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg @DRUG$ and 12 g @DRUG$ resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
3315	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
3316	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
3317	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3318	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3319	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
3320	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3321	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
3322	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
3323	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
3324	DDI-effect	Chlorpromazine: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$ and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.
3325	DDI-mechanism	Sulindac: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.
3326	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
3327	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ renal clearance and increases lithium plasma levels.
3328	DDI-effect	Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., @DRUG$), ephedrine, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
3329	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
3330	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3331	DDI-mechanism	This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.
3332	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or @DRUG$.
3333	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: @DRUG$ (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3334	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
3335	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, @DRUG$, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3336	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen: A report of severe @DRUG$ toxicity was reported in a patient receiving @DRUG$.
3337	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
3338	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3339	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3340	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3341	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other @DRUG$ metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3342	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3343	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3344	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with benzodiazepines or @DRUG$.
3345	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with @DRUG$ and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc).
3346	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
3347	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
3348	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and @DRUG$] is contraindicated.
3349	DDI-mechanism	This small decrease in excretion of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ is not expected to be of clinical importance.
3350	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
3351	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or @DRUG$-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3352	DDI-advise	"for adult-onset diabetics, dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary during and after @DRUG$ therapy;"
3353	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other @DRUG$ such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
3354	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, @DRUG$, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3355	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3356	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
3357	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3358	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
3359	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of @DRUG$ bioavailability.
3360	DDI-effect	However, reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
3361	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
3362	DDI-effect	Caffeine-related adverse effects have occurred in patients consuming @DRUG$ while on therapy with @DRUG$.
3363	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of @DRUG$ in serum.
3364	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3365	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, procaine, or @DRUG$.
3366	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
3367	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or @DRUG$, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
3368	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3369	DDI-mechanism	Indinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an 83% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 51% increase in indinavir plasma A.C.
3370	DDI-effect	The potential for increased sedation when @DRUG$ is given with other @DRUG$ should be appreciated.
3371	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3372	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3373	DDI-advise	Therefore when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ their dosage should be reduced.
3374	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3375	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
3376	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
3377	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other @DRUG$.
3378	DDI-advise	Lithium serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3379	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have been reported to increase steadystate plasma @DRUG$ levels.
3380	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of alcohol, @DRUG$, and other CNS depressants.
3381	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3382	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3383	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
3384	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3385	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3386	DDI-effect	Paclitaxel - In one report, @DRUG$ at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving @DRUG$, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
3387	DDI-effect	In an emergency situation when opioid analgesia must be administered to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the amount of @DRUG$ required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged.
3388	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3389	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3390	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3391	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3392	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3393	DDI-mechanism	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The administration of @DRUG$ to normal volunteers receiving @DRUG$ decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
3394	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or with other anticholinesterase agents.
3395	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs including @DRUG$ has been reported.
3396	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3397	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
3398	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of @DRUG$, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
3399	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
3400	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3401	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3402	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, @DRUG$, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3403	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3404	DDI-effect	Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals.
3405	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ increased exposure of @DRUG$ (AUC) by 46%.
3406	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3407	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3408	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels.
3409	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, @DRUG$ or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
3410	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (Desyrel) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
3411	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
3412	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or @DRUG$) are additive.
3413	DDI-mechanism	MAO inhibitors @DRUG$, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow @DRUG$ metabolism.
3414	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen.
3415	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium sparing, and @DRUG$.
3416	DDI-advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$.
3417	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to or withdrawn from treatment, dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required.
3418	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
3419	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of @DRUG$ was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with @DRUG$ compared to when it was given alone.
3420	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3421	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
3422	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Since both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated.
3423	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing @DRUG$, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3424	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3425	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
3426	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
3427	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
3428	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3429	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
3430	DDI-advise	@DRUG$: generally should not be given with @DRUG$.
3431	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking @DRUG$ to whom @DRUG$ was administered.
3432	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3433	DDI-effect	Phenytoin: Serum @DRUG$ levels may be increased by @DRUG$.
3434	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
3435	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
3436	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
3437	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3438	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3439	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine resin may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation, The discontinuance of @DRUG$ resin could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as @DRUG$ has been filtrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking cholestyramine resin.
3440	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
3441	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ are a major contributing factor to @DRUG$ toxicity.
3442	DDI-effect	Loperamide and @DRUG$ (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the @DRUG$ (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.
3443	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
3444	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3445	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of low-dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow.
3446	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines @DRUG$, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3447	DDI-advise	However, interactions may be expected, and @DRUG$ should NOT be used in combination with other @DRUG$.
3448	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
3449	DDI-advise	Therefore, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated, and alternative hypoglycemic agents should be considered.
3450	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
3451	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, @DRUG$, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3452	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedating drugs.
3453	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and Corticotropin (ACTH): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
3454	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, @DRUG$, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
3455	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, @DRUG$, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3456	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.
3457	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
3458	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3459	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
3460	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
3461	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the dosage of warfarin should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time.
3462	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, @DRUG$, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3463	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3464	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
3465	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3466	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other @DRUG$, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3467	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3468	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ with potent diuretics such as @DRUG$.
3469	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
3470	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3471	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3472	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
3473	DDI-advise	These results would seem to dictate against the clinical use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, or during the period following ELSPAR therapy when plasma asparagine levels are below normal.
3474	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3475	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent @DRUG$ such as furosemide.
3476	DDI-mechanism	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ (200 m m M i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17-28%.
3477	DDI-mechanism	However, in the second study, administration of 12 g @DRUG$ 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg @DRUG$ approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the cerivastatin AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
3478	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
3479	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3480	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3481	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3482	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
3483	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
3484	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3485	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.
3486	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
3487	DDI-effect	Loperamide and @DRUG$ (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the @DRUG$ (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.
3488	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
3489	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3490	DDI-effect	The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of @DRUG$ is antagonized by @DRUG$.
3491	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of @DRUG$ such as dopamine or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
3492	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ are given in conjunction with @DRUG$.
3493	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or @DRUG$-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
3494	DDI-effect	With simultaneous dosing of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 10 mg, 2 of 9 subjects experienced a standing systolic blood pressure of less than 85 mm Hg.
3495	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
3496	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
3497	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
3498	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some @DRUG$.
3499	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
3500	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3501	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
3502	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Immediate Release Capsules: There have been rare reports of an interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (with a decreased plasma level of quinidine).
3503	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3504	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3505	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3506	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3507	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
3508	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
3509	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3510	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3511	DDI-mechanism	At higher than recommended doses, @DRUG$ 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving @DRUG$ 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
3512	DDI-advise	Because @DRUG$ have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on @DRUG$ therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
3513	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3514	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3515	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3516	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3517	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3518	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, @DRUG$ or warfarin.
3519	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
3520	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
3521	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with @DRUG$/aluminum-containing antacids.
3522	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
3523	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
3524	DDI-mechanism	However, patients on @DRUG$ may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
3525	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3526	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including @DRUG$, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
3527	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
3528	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and @DRUG$) is contraindicated .
3529	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3530	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
3531	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
3532	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may also decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, which can lead to a deficiency.
3533	DDI-mechanism	H2 Receptor Antagonists: @DRUG$ coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and AUC of @DRUG$, there is no effect on cisapride absorption when it is coadministered with ranitidine.
3534	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3535	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3536	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
3537	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
3538	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cimetidine, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied
3539	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, @DRUG$, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3540	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, @DRUG$, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
3541	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
3542	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3543	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
3544	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (@DRUG$, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
3545	DDI-advise	Patients receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.
3546	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, @DRUG$ (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3547	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal contraceptives Co-administration of @DRUG$ with an oral @DRUG$ has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG).
3548	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (@DRUG$).
3549	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3550	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3551	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3552	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3553	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
3554	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
3555	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3556	DDI-advise	It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3557	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
3558	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases urinary excretion of @DRUG$ and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect.
3559	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
3560	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is withdrawn from the combination therapy, @DRUG$ dose should then be reduced.
3561	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3562	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3563	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
3564	DDI-advise	The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotensin can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
3565	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3566	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or @DRUG$.
3567	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
3568	DDI-advise	It is not known if the effects of @DRUG$ are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (@DRUG$, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed.
3569	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
3570	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
3571	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
3572	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3573	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
3574	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3575	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3576	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with diuretics (such as @DRUG$) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3577	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
3578	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3579	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3580	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing @DRUG$ (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3581	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including @DRUG$ and Myochrysine.
3582	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
3583	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
3584	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3585	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3586	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3587	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of R-warfarin and @DRUG$ (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3588	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with @DRUG$.
3589	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some @DRUG$.
3590	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
3591	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used together.
3592	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3593	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, @DRUG$, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
3594	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the @DRUG$ C max by 23% and ceftibuten AUC by 16%.
3595	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral @DRUG$ increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.
3596	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3597	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, phenytoin, or @DRUG$ increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3598	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
3599	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
3600	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3601	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
3602	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.
3603	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, @DRUG$, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3604	DDI-advise	In patients receiving @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ concomitantly, any reduction in steroid dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden steroid withdrawal.
3605	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
3606	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3607	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3608	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3609	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving @DRUG$ and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
3610	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3611	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with @DRUG$ or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
3612	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3613	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3614	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
3615	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3616	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased 62% when coadministered with @DRUG$ and 38% when coadministered with ketoconazole.
3617	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (@DRUG$, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
3618	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and tramadol (@DRUG$).
3619	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, @DRUG$(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3620	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
3621	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered.
3622	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC values by 14%.
3623	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, @DRUG$, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3624	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3625	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
3626	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3627	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (@DRUG$, Cuprimine), another arthritis medication.
3628	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3629	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactams, the renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
3630	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
3631	DDI-advise	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by carbamazepine overdose with a positive tricyclic antidepressant level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of @DRUG$ with a toxicology screen for @DRUG$.
3632	DDI-mechanism	In addition, higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking @DRUG$.
3633	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, @DRUG$, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3634	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
3635	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3636	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.

3643	DDI-mechanism	Enhanced @DRUG$ clearance secondary to @DRUG$ therapy.
3644	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or @DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3645	DDI-mechanism	Ibuprofen - @DRUG$ may increase the absorption of @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.

3654	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
3655	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3656	DDI-advise	A 5-mg @DRUG$ dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily @DRUG$.

3658	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ decreased the maximum plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.
3659	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3660	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3661	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
3662	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.

3664	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
3665	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
3666	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
3667	DDI-mechanism	Midazolam: @DRUG$ increased the AUC of @DRUG$, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, by 2.3-fold on Day 1 and 3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg was coadministered on Day 1 and Day 5 of a regimen of Aprepitant 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 through 5.
3668	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .

3671	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3672	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like @DRUG$ (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
3673	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
3674	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3675	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

3678	DDI-advise	If you are also using a steroid inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the @DRUG$ inhaler.
3679	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
3680	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3681	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
3682	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3683	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3684	DDI-mechanism	The clearance of @DRUG$ may be increased with concurrent use of @DRUG$.
3685	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3686	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3687	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
3688	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3689	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: @DRUG$, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3690	DDI-mechanism	Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
3691	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3692	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous @DRUG$ (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3693	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, dexamethasone, @DRUG$) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3694	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3695	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, @DRUG$, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3696	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
3697	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
3698	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic @DRUG$ abuse, reserpine
3699	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and @DRUG$-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
3700	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
3701	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
3702	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
3703	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
3704	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
3705	DDI-mechanism	Even so @DRUG$ plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of @DRUG$ were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.
3706	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, @DRUG$, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3707	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3708	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3709	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3710	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
3711	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
3712	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3713	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
3714	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic @DRUG$, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3715	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3716	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, @DRUG$, lovastatin, simvastatin).
3717	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3718	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3719	DDI-int	Medications can interfere with folate utilization, including: anticonvulsant medications (such as phenytoin, and primidone) metformin (sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes) sulfasalazine (used to control inflammation associated with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) triamterene (a diuretic) Methotrexate There has been concern about the interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3720	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3721	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3722	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
3723	DDI-mechanism	Ethosuximide: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$.
3724	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of adenosine may be required or @DRUG$ may not be effective.
3725	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3726	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3727	DDI-mechanism	In patients given very high doses (3900 mg) of @DRUG$ daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when @DRUG$, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.
3728	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
3729	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
3730	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3731	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, @DRUG$ chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3732	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
3733	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3734	DDI-advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg @DRUG$ dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$.
3735	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of @DRUG$ capsules (250 mg) with @DRUG$ (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.
3736	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
3737	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
3738	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of @DRUG$ decreased 15% with coadministration of @DRUG$ relative to that observed with erythromycin alone.
3739	DDI-mechanism	Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when @DRUG$ was given with @DRUG$.
3740	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, iron salts and @DRUG$).
3741	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
3742	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
3743	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
3744	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients under @DRUG$ therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant @DRUG$ therapy is indicated.
3745	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced.
3746	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3747	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3748	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3749	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduces urinary excretion of @DRUG$ and may enhance its effect.
3750	DDI-mechanism	Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the @DRUG$ have been reported upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant 6.
3751	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3752	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3753	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.

3794	DDI-mechanism	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medicaoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or @DRUG$ in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
3795	DDI-advise	Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3796	DDI-mechanism	By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, @DRUG$ may decrease serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect.
3797	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol.
3798	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"

3808	DDI-advise	The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning although they do not bear directly on the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3809	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3810	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3811	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3812	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.

3817	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
3818	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
3819	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3820	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3821	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3822	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3823	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
3824	DDI-advise	Thus, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
3825	DDI-mechanism	Urinary alkalinizing agents (@DRUG$, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
3826	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
3827	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
3828	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3829	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3830	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
3831	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.

3833	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
3834	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is withdrawn from the combination therapy, @DRUG$ dose should then be reduced.
3835	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases lithium renal clearance and increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3836	DDI-advise	Since @DRUG$ are potentiated by the @DRUG$, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions.
3837	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
3838	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, @DRUG$, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3839	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3840	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other @DRUG$ that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin.
3841	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3842	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
3843	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$ careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.
3844	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
3845	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3846	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3847	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

3849	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3850	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3851	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
3852	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).

3987	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3988	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3989	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
3990	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3991	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3992	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3993	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
3994	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3995	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used cautiously in conjunction with @DRUG$ in hypoprothrombinemia.
3996	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, @DRUG$, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3997	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
3998	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ Antimycobacterial agents: @DRUG$
3999	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
4000	DDI-advise	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because aspirin increases the rate of excretion of Nalfon, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
4001	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4002	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
4003	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, @DRUG$) should be considered.
4004	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (Depen, @DRUG$), another arthritis medication.
4005	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
4006	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
4007	DDI-advise	It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ containing antacids for at least 4 hours following ethambutol administration.
4008	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
4009	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
4010	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
4011	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
4012	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as @DRUG$, thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
4013	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
4014	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
4015	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with @DRUG$ (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
4016	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
4017	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
4018	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
4019	DDI-advise	The benefits and risks of using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed
4020	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., @DRUG$) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
4021	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
4022	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
4023	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
4024	DDI-advise	These @DRUG$ should be used in the myasthenic patient only where definitely indicated, and then careful adjustment should be made of adjunctive @DRUG$ dosage.
4025	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (@DRUG$), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4026	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
4027	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or @DRUG$, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
4028	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
4029	DDI-advise	Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
4030	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
4031	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
4032	DDI-advise	Concurrent therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
4033	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
4034	DDI-advise	Oral Anticoagulants CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN @DRUG$ ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH @DRUG$.
4035	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, @DRUG$ and nefazadone) .
4036	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
4037	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
4038	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4039	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption .
4040	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4041	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or @DRUG$, and high blood pressure medications.
4042	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
4043	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
4044	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
4045	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
4046	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
4047	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
4048	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
4049	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4050	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
4051	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, @DRUG$s, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
4052	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
4053	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), @DRUG$ (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
4054	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
4055	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
4056	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, and nifedipine.
4057	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
4058	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines, or @DRUG$.
4059	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
4060	DDI-advise	Barbiturates and @DRUG$ should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
4061	DDI-advise	Because @DRUG$ have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on @DRUG$ therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
4062	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
4063	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
4064	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
4065	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4066	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
4067	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, @DRUG$, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
4068	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
4069	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
4070	DDI-advise	Therefore you may need to take a @DRUG$ supplement while taking @DRUG$.
4071	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4072	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
4073	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4074	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
4075	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4076	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
4077	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
4078	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
4079	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
4080	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, @DRUG$, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
4081	DDI-advise	Therefore, when using doses of @DRUG$ greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of @DRUG$ may be required.
4082	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
4083	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving cyclopropane or @DRUG$.
4084	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

4096	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
4097	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
4098	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
4099	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
4100	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, @DRUG$, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.

4152	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
4153	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as @DRUG$, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4154	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, @DRUG$) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
4155	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (@DRUG$, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4156	DDI-advise	Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing @DRUG$ therapy in patients receiving @DRUG$ or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.
4157	DDI-advise	Patients who have been treated with @DRUG$ within two to three weeks prior to the administration of @DRUG$ should receive initial doses of dopamine HCl no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
4158	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
4159	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, @DRUG$, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
4160	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
4161	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4162	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
4163	DDI-advise	Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and @DRUG$ has been observed, it is not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
4164	DDI-advise	Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully, and the dose of warfarin sodium or other coumarin-like drugs should be adjusted accordingly, in patients taking both drugs.
4165	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
4166	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4167	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

4169	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
4170	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
4171	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), @DRUG$ (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4172	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
4173	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
4174	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
4175	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4176	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral @DRUG$ are given.
4177	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4178	DDI-advise	Careful observation is required when @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
4179	DDI-advise	Thus patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.
4180	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, @DRUG$, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
4181	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4182	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
4183	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
4184	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, cyclosporin for injection concentrate and @DRUG$ for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
4185	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

4194	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
4195	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
4196	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
4197	DDI-advise	However, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ since these patients are at increased risk of bleeding complications.
