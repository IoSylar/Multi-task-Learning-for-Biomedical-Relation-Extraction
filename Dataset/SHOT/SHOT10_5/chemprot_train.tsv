However, at greater concentrations of prazosin, there is a paradoxical accumulation of [(3)H]-prazosin which we have attributed to Transport-P. Uptake of prazosin via Transport-P is detectable at 10(-10) M prazosin concentration, is linear up to 10(-7) M and at greater concentrations becomes non-linear.

7	CPRFalse	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate @CHEMICAL$ secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). @GENE$ potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 mM)."

13	CPR:3	As add-on therapy in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control despite oral antihyperglycaemic treatment, sitagliptin improved @CHEMICAL$ to a significantly greater extent than placebo when added to @GENE$ or pioglitazone and was noninferior to glipizide when added to metformin.
14	CPR:4	These channels have a conductance of 14 pS. TREK-1 currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block @CHEMICAL$ activity such as @GENE$ and quinidine.
15	CPR:4	Troglitazone inhibited the antigen-induced production of LTB(4), C(4) and E(4) and the potency of the inhibition was comparable to that of @CHEMICAL$, a specific inhibitor of @GENE$ (5-LOX) and a clinically used anti-asthmatic drug.

21	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ and EP(3) receptor antagonists ONO-8713 and @GENE$, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth.
22	CPR:4	The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function, structural changes, renal malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (@CHEMICAL$), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) genes expression in @GENE$ injected rats.
23	CPR:4	"In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of @CHEMICAL$ on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and @GENE$) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD."

25	CPR:9	The activity of CYP3A in excised liver samples from rats following multiple baicalin treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (P<0.05), whereas multiple doses of baicalin had no obvious effect on the activity of CYP2D. Taken together, these data demonstrate that baicalin inhibits the metabolism of @CHEMICAL$ in a concentration-dependent manner in rats, possibly through inhibiting hepatic @GENE$ and CYP3A activities.

37	CPR:3	Furthermore, substance P (SP) concentration in the acini and expression of @CHEMICAL$ gene (preprotachykinin-A, PPT-A) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the primary receptor for SP, are increased in secretagogue @GENE$-treated acinar cells.
