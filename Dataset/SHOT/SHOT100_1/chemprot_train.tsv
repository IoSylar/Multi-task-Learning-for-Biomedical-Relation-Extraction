110	CPR:4	Particularly, the effects of @CHEMICAL$ used as a non selective @GENE$ inhibitor in experimental and clinical studies will be discussed.
111	CPRFalse	This suggests that plant @CHEMICAL$ represent a distinct group in the eukaryotic @GENE$ racemase family and can be clustered into monocot and dicot types.
112	CPRFalse	The functional response of reIL-4-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. ReIL-4 either increased the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducible @CHEMICAL$ synthase (iNOS), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and @GENE$ (TNF-alpha) on CXCL-8.
113	CPRFalse	@CHEMICAL$, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduces Na(+) influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with @GENE$: comparison with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.
114	CPRFalse	These results suggest that ATP-bound @CHEMICAL$ may be the specific target of @GENE$-sensitive TOP2 poisons.
115	CPRFalse	Pelargonidin activates the AhR and induces CYP1A1 in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines HepG2 and LS174T. We examined the effects of @CHEMICAL$ (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, pelargonidin) on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-@GENE$ signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells.
116	CPRFalse	These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on @CHEMICAL$ secretion: namely, @GENE$ and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.
117	CPRFalse	"On days 0 and 35, patients' nutritional status was assessed by BMI, normalized protein catabolic rate, predialytic creatinine, serum albumin and transthyretin; lipid metabolism by plasma LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, @CHEMICAL$, phospholipids, apo A-I, A-II, B, C-II, C-III, E and lipoprotein (a); oxidative status by alpha-tocopherol, retinol, selenium, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and advanced oxidized protein products; inflammatory status by serum C-reactive protein, @GENE$, IL-2 and IL-6."
118	CPRFalse	Using the mTOR inhibitor @CHEMICAL$ we found that TGFb-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for @GENE$ suppression.
119	CPRFalse	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a (@CHEMICAL$) activation mimicked the effects of @GENE$ while PPARa inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator.
120	CPR:9	In breast cancer, intratumoural @CHEMICAL$ is the source for local @GENE$ production in the tissue.
121	CPRFalse	An article presented in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology (p. 1527) provides an intriguing example of how @CHEM-GENE$ inhibitors can be put to many uses.
122	CPRFalse	One major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent activities of the @CHEM-GENE$ (GDC, EC 2.1.1.10) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1) with glycine (Gly) as one-carbon (1-C) source.
123	CPRFalse	Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate @CHEMICAL$ activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive @GENE$ influx.
124	CPRFalse	"The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists SB224289 (300 microg/kg; @CHEMICAL$), BRL15572 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1D), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg; alpha2), SB224289 + BRL15572 (300 microg/kg each), SB224289 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), BRL15572 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg; alpha1), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), @GENE$ (300 microg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + BRL44408 (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2A), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2B), or SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + MK912 (300 microg/kg; alpha2C)."
125	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of @CHEMICAL$, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. @GENE$ did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.
126	CPRFalse	Furthermore, OMT significantly reversed the up-regulation of @CHEMICAL$ and inhibited the calcium overload in the cultured neurons after challenging the @GENE$.
127	CPRFalse	These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of @CHEM-GENE$ and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.
128	CPR:4	METHODS: @CHEMICAL$ inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg @GENE$ and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily).
129	CPR:4	As opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, @CHEMICAL$ was hardly inhibited by @GENE$ concentrations up to 5 mM. In the absence of sodium, however, lithium can mediate succinate-dependent currents.
130	CPR:4	Dexamethasone (DXM) decreased the expression of CXCL-8, VEGF, and iNOS induced by reIL-4, while @CHEMICAL$ (1400W), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, decreased the expression of E-selectin, @GENE$, and iNOS.
131	CPR:3	The studies with dThyd rescue from @CHEMICAL$-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by @GENE$ indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance.
132	CPR:4	Glutaraldehyde crosslinked albumin nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the @CHEMICAL$ inhibitor @GENE$-L(x)-a platinum-bound sunitinib analogue-which couples the drug to methionine residues of albumin and is released in a reductive environment.
133	CPR:9	PIP5K1B encodes @CHEMICAL$ (pip5k1b), an enzyme functionally linked to actin cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [@GENE$] to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2].
134	CPR:9	These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating @CHEMICAL$ activity or stability as a part of @GENE$ homeostasis.
135	CPR:4	Importantly, pre-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (@CHEMICAL$), an inhibitor of @GENE$, prevented a-MeDA induced increase in GSH levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity.
136	CPR:4	PURPOSE: To compare @CHEMICAL$ (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (@GENE$) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (ALA-T).
137	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of @GENE$ and the nuclear translocation of b-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by b-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells.
138	CPR:4	Inhibition of endogenous production of @CHEMICAL$ by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, @GENE$ expression and NK1-R expression in the acini.
139	CPR:9	One of the enzymes responsible for the production of @CHEMICAL$, @GENE$ (KATI), also catalyses the reversible transamination of glutamine to oxoglutaramic acid (GTK, EC 2.6.1.15).
140	CPR:4	Among the isolated compounds, trans-dihydromorin (8), @CHEMICAL$ (9), and steppogenin (12) were found to exhibit significant @GENE$ inhibition activities.
141	CPR:4	We found that @CHEMICAL$ inhibits @GENE$ (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line.
142	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ exhibited a significantly higher Vmax and Km values toward both HFC and UDP-@GENE$ than the other UGTs. 5.  Human, pig and rabbit, but not rat liver microsomes, catalyzed HFC glucuronidation at high rates. 6.  This new method is particularly suitable for fast activity screenings of UGTs 1A6, 1A7, 1A10 and 2A1 and HFC glucuronidation activity determination from various samples.
143	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ (PDTC), a specific NF-kB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced @GENE$ expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-kB activity.
144	CPR:9	Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or @CHEMICAL$ significantly inhibited @GENE$ (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP).
145	CPR:4	Synthesis and evaluation of carbamoylmethylene linked prodrugs of @CHEMICAL$, a clinical @GENE$ inhibitor.
146	CPR:4	Taken together, our findings indicate that @CHEMICAL$ suppresses NO production through modulation of iNOS, consequently suppressing @GENE$ activity and induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activity.
147	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ (10(-5) M), a selective @GENE$ antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor.
148	CPR:3	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of @CHEMICAL$ secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor @GENE$ (1 mM)."
149	CPR:3	Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of @CHEMICAL$ mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (@GENE$), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme.
150	CPR:3	@CHEMICAL$ treatment resulted in the decrease in p27(kip1) expression, with an increase in @GENE$ and cdk2 protein expression and kinase activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure.
151	CPR:4	In the in vitro assay, @CHEMICAL$ (20 and 50mg/mL) markedly inhibited changes in various biochemical substances (nitric oxide (NO), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (@GENE$)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) damaged by high glucose (35mM) and restored vascular endothelial structure by balancing the matrix metalloproteinases-the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-TIMP) system.
152	CPR:6	The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosages of the nonsedating @CHEMICAL$ antagonists terfenadine, astemizole, @GENE$, and acrivastine are reviewed.

156	CPR:4	A series of phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, @CHEMICAL$, and ellagic acid, were investigated for their inhibitory effects against the metalloenzyme @GENE$ (CA, EC 4.2.1.1).
157	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ is responsible for @GENE$ conversion to lactate through glycolysis.
158	CPR:4	They display sensitivity to @CHEMICAL$ inhibitors, including gefitinib and @GENE$.
159	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ inhibited @GENE$-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor.
160	CPR:3	Central @CHEMICAL$ receptor stimulation by @GENE$ increases blood glucose in rats.
161	CPR:6	EP(1) and @CHEMICAL$ antagonists @GENE$ and ONO-AE3-240, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth.
162	CPR:4	Similar to @CHEMICAL$, clofibrate, another fibrate drug, also inhibited the expression of @GENE$.
163	CPR:4	Felodipine and nicardipine have similar affinities for 60-kDa @CHEMICAL$ isozymes but bring about different levels of enzyme inhibition, suggesting the possibility of designing specific drugs that can protect the enzyme from inhibition by @GENE$ Ca2+-channel blockers.
164	CPR:4	Using standard assays, @CHEMICAL$ was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified @GENE$ and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2.

166	CPR:4	Pregnane X Receptor Mediates Dyslipidemia Induced by the @CHEMICAL$ Inhibitor @GENE$ in Mice.
167	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ is synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and @GENE$ (PGES) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four prostanoid receptors EP(1) through EP(4).
168	CPR:4	This mutation is inherently resistant to imatinib and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with KITD816V. @CHEMICAL$ (BMS-354825) is a novel orally bioavailable @GENE$/ABL inhibitor that has activity against multiple imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
169	CPR:4	First, in the presence of 1 mm ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate, TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage induced by ATP-sensitive @CHEMICAL$ poisons (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide, @GENE$, and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was 30-100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by ATP-insensitive TOP2 poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and menadione) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected.

178	CPR:4	The @CHEMICAL$ (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitory activities of a series of pyrano[2,3-b]quinolines (2, 3), [1,8]naphthyridines (5, 6), 4-amino-2,3-diaryl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-b]quinolines (11-13)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5H-cyclohepta[e]furo[2,3-b]pyridine (14), @GENE$ (15)/ 4-amino-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2,3-diphenyl-5H-cyclohepta[e]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine (16) are described.
179	CPR:4	In unstimulated cells, @CHEMICAL$ dose-dependently reduced the @GENE$ activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microM. When HUVECs were stimulated by thrombin without extracellular L-arginine, Nor-NOHA dose-dependently increased the NOS activity and the NO release with maximal effects at 20 microM.

474	CPR:6	Like other @CHEMICAL$ antagonists, @GENE$ at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory.
475	CPR:6	In the rabbit pulmonary artery, rilmenidine and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the @CHEMICAL$, sharing this property with @GENE$, phentolamine, and idazoxan.

488	CPR:5	In further studies, the diuretic effects of the CB1 agonist AM4054 were similar in male and female rats, displayed a relatively rapid onset to action, and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 minutes pretreatment with rimonabant, but not by the vanilloid receptor type I antagonist capsazepine, nor were the effects of @CHEMICAL$ antagonized by the @GENE$ antagonist AM630 [(6-iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl) methanone)].

498	CPR:6	"At 3 mmol kg(-1), all agonists induced apoptosis (fenoterol, 1.1 +/- 0.1%; isoprenaline, 0.9 +/- 0.8%; and clenbuterol, 0.4 +/- 0.07%; P < 0.05). @CHEMICAL$ antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) @GENE$) prevented 92% (P < 0.05) of apoptosis induced by all three agonists, but clenbuterol-induced apoptosis could also be prevented by 96% (P < 0.05) by beta(2)-AR antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) ICI 118 551)."
499	CPR:5	Systemic administration of @CHEMICAL$ agonists, formoterol and @GENE$, elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats at micromolar doses. beta(2)-Adrenoceptor agonists provide a potential therapy for muscle wasting and weakness, but their use may be limited by adverse effects on the heart, mediated in part, by beta(1)-adrenoceptor activation.
500	CPR:5	Methanandamide (10.0 mg/kg) had lesser effect than other CB agonists, and the @CHEMICAL$ agonist AM1241 [1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl)indole], the anandamide transport inhibitor @GENE$, and the CB antagonist rimonabant did not have diuretic effects.

524	CPR:6	These results indicate that the positive inotropic effect, mediated via @CHEMICAL$- and oxymetazoline-sensitive subtype of @GENE$, is exerted by a subcellular mechanism that is independent of the accumulation of inositol phosphates.
525	CPR:5	@CHEMICAL$ (D-1997): a novel agonist at @GENE$ in the canine basilar artery.
526	CPR:6	In further studies, the diuretic effects of the CB1 agonist AM4054 were similar in male and female rats, displayed a relatively rapid onset to action, and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 minutes pretreatment with rimonabant, but not by the @CHEMICAL$ antagonist @GENE$, nor were the effects of WIN 55,212 antagonized by the CB2 antagonist AM630 [(6-iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl) methanone)].

530	CPR:5	While there is considerable indirect evidence to implicate @CHEMICAL$ in the pathogenesis of asthma, a critical evaluation of @GENE$ antagonism in this condition has, until recently, proved difficult, as many of the early H1-receptor antagonists possessed additional actions, such as anti-cholinergic, local anaesthetic, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonistic and anti-serotonin activity.

532	CPR:6	In addition, by comparing the combined administration of (+/-)pindolol with either WAY100635, GR127935 or isamoltane, we have determined that @CHEMICAL$ produces much of its acute potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT via its action at the 5-HT(1B/D) receptor in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic @GENE$ receptor.
533	CPR:6	At 100 nM and higher, it suppressed the maximal response to phenylephrine. @CHEMICAL$ effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine even after inactivation of @GENE$ by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine. (+/-)-Tamsulosin, over the range of concentrations at which it antagonized the positive inotropic effect mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, did not affect the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates that was induced by 10 microM phenylephrine.
534	CPR:5	Epinastine (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7% at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined @CHEMICAL$/5-HT2 antagonists, methysergide (1 microM) or methiothepin (0.1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of @GENE$ on the noncholinergic contraction.

544	CPR:6	Terfenadine and @CHEMICAL$ are chemically unrelated to @GENE$ antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine.
545	CPR:6	Pretreatment with tropisetron (1 microM), a 5-HT3 antagonist, @CHEMICAL$ (10 microM), a @GENE$ antagonist, thioperamide (10 microM), a histamine H3 antagonist, or phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect.
546	CPR:6	Clinical effects of @CHEMICAL$, an oral @GENE$ antagonist, in mild-to-moderate asthma: a 4 week randomized multicentre controlled trial.
