122	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
123	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, @DRUG$.
124	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
125	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
126	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedatives.
127	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
128	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
129	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, @DRUG$ or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
130	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants, including @DRUG$, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
131	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general @DRUG$.
132	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

134	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain @DRUG$ or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
135	DDI-advise	Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of @DRUG$, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
136	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
137	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
138	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Since both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated.
139	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: @DRUG$ enhances the effect of warfarin.

145	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
146	DDI-effect	There have been isolated reports of patients experiencing increases in their prothrombin times when @DRUG$ was added to @DRUG$ therapy.
147	DDI-mechanism	In vitro data suggest that @DRUG$, when compared to ketoconazole, has a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
148	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (@DRUG$, Cuprimine), another arthritis medication.
149	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
150	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as @DRUG$ and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
151	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
152	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates, alcohol, and other CNS depressants.
153	DDI-mechanism	Although not observed in this study, adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems.
154	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished binding of @DRUG$ by a net change of 9.9% (percentage increase in FDF, 21.2%) at 1732 micromol/L.
155	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
156	DDI-effect	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
157	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates and other @DRUG$
158	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
159	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
160	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), @DRUG$ (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
161	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (@DRUG$, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
162	DDI-effect	Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: @DRUG$ attenuates potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
163	DDI-effect	Paclitaxel - In one report, @DRUG$ at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving @DRUG$, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
164	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
165	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
166	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
167	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
168	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
169	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
170	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
171	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
172	DDI-effect	Non-selective MAO inhibitors including tranylcypromine sulfate, phenelzine sulfate, and pargyline HC1: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and non-selective @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
173	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
174	DDI-effect	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin.
175	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
176	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
177	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
178	DDI-effect	Amantadine, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
179	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
180	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
181	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
182	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that @DRUG$, erythromycin, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
183	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
184	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
185	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
186	DDI-effect	Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed @DRUG$ preparations (minipills that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during @DRUG$ therapy.
187	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
188	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may occur when the two are used concurrently.
189	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
190	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
191	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
192	DDI-effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ but may be seen after several months.
193	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
194	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
195	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
196	DDI-advise	Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of @DRUG$ are to be administered with @DRUG$ because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
197	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
198	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
199	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
200	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
201	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
202	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
203	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
204	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
205	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on platelet aggregation, but did slightly enhance the inhibition of platelet aggregation by @DRUG$.
206	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
207	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
208	DDI-effect	Lamivudine: In vitro studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, U937 and Molt-4 cells revealed that @DRUG$ significantly inhibited @DRUG$ phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner.
209	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
210	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or inhalation general anesthetics.
211	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and @DRUG$.
212	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
213	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
214	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as halothane which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia..
215	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
216	DDI-advise	Anticoagulants: While studies have not shown @DRUG$ to interact with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, caution should be exercised, nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other @DRUG$.
217	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: @DRUG$, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
218	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
219	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
220	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
221	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as @DRUG$) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
222	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
223	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
224	DDI-effect	Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$, and it is possible that the administration of @DRUG$ as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
225	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
226	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including @DRUG$) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
227	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
228	DDI-effect	With simultaneous dosing of @DRUG$ 10 mg and @DRUG$ 10 mg, 6 of 8 subjects experienced a standing systolic blood pressure of less than 85 mm Hg.
229	DDI-effect	Inhibitors Of Endogenous Prostaglandin Synthesis It has been reported that @DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$, especially in cases of low renin hypertension.
230	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ (equivalent to 145 mg TRICOR) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
231	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
232	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
233	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
234	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
235	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
236	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
237	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure of @DRUG$ (10 mg BID) was increased by 28% following administration of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID) for 12 days, while plasma exposure of valdecoxib (40 mg BID) was not substantially increased following administration of diazepam (10 mg BID) for 12 days.
238	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
239	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
240	DDI-advise	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because aspirin increases the rate of excretion of Nalfon, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
241	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other @DRUG$ such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
242	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ can combine to cause dangerous hypertension.
243	DDI-effect	The addition of 540 mg/kg/day of @DRUG$ (approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) to 2.7 mg/kg/day of @DRUG$ (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations.
244	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
245	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
246	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., @DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
247	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
248	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
249	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
250	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
251	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal contraceptives Co-administration of @DRUG$ with an oral @DRUG$ has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG).
252	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
253	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
254	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
255	DDI-effect	Because @DRUG$ may enhance the serotonergic effects of @DRUG$, caution should be exercised when LEXAPRO and lithium are coadministered.
256	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and @DRUG$, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
257	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ sometimes proves to be fatal when used in combination with @DRUG$.
258	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on platelet aggregation, but did slightly enhance the inhibition of platelet aggregation by @DRUG$.
259	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
260	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
261	DDI-effect	In ewes given 40 mg of @DRUG$/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present.
262	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
263	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
264	DDI-effect	Particular caution should be observed with @DRUG$ since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin.
265	DDI-effect	Using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (heart medicine) may cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat.
266	DDI-effect	The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of @DRUG$ is antagonized by @DRUG$.
267	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
268	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
269	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, @DRUG$, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
270	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
271	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
272	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ toxicity may be aggravated by the initial release of norepinephrine caused by @DRUG$ Injection.
273	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
274	DDI-advise	If intravenous @DRUG$ is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with @DRUG$ should be interrupted.
275	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/@DRUG$ or zidovudine.
276	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
277	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
278	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
279	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
280	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
281	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
282	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
283	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
284	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
285	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease emetic response to @DRUG$.
286	DDI-advise	Thus, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
287	DDI-effect	Injection of @DRUG$ 5 min before a nonlethal dose of @DRUG$ changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to endotoxin.
288	DDI-effect	Furosemide: @DRUG$ IV/IM reduced the diuretic response to @DRUG$ in normovolemic healthy subjects by approximately 20% (mean sodium and urinary output decreased 17%).
289	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$, causing increased sedative effects.
290	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
291	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and @DRUG$, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
292	DDI-effect	Since animal studies suggest that the action of @DRUG$ may be prolonged by therapy with @DRUG$, barbiturates should be employed with caution.
293	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
294	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
295	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
296	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ - @DRUG$ may potentiate the tardive dyskinesia side reactions of neuroleptic drugs if used concomitantly with them.
297	DDI-mechanism	Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 Cimetidine: @DRUG$ inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
298	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.
299	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
300	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
301	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
302	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
303	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
304	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
305	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
306	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
307	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
308	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ steady-state Cmax, A.C. and Cmin were increased 21%, decreased 19%, and decreased 48%, respectively, by concomitant @DRUG$.
309	DDI-effect	In a small (n=30) combination study of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, a 2- to 3-fold elevation in liver enzymes was seen in 5 of 30 patients.
310	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
311	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
312	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
313	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
314	DDI-effect	apomorphine - prior ingestion of @DRUG$ may decrease the emetic response to @DRUG$ in the treatment of poisoning.
315	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using @DRUG$ or digitalis concomitantly with @DRUG$.
316	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, opiates, and alcohol.
317	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
318	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
319	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
320	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, @DRUG$, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
321	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
322	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
323	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
324	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (@DRUG$, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
325	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, vaiproic acid, and sodium valproate.
326	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ decreased the maximum plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.
327	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and @DRUG$) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
328	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
329	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
330	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$.
331	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
332	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
333	DDI-mechanism	Patients taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of disopyramide resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
334	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other @DRUG$.
335	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
336	DDI-mechanism	The clearance of @DRUG$ may be increased with concurrent use of @DRUG$.
337	DDI-mechanism	Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin): Steady state plasma exposure (AUC) of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 12 days) was decreased by 27% when co-administered with multiple doses (300 mg QD for 12 days) of @DRUG$ (a CYP 3A4 inducer).
338	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
339	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
340	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the zidovudine tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated @DRUG$ by 110%.
341	DDI-advise	However, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ since these patients are at increased risk of bleeding complications.
342	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
343	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
344	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
345	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, @DRUG$, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
346	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, @DRUG$(1), verapamil, zileuton.
347	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
348	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
349	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of @DRUG$.
350	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
351	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
352	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
353	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
354	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
355	DDI-advise	A 5-mg @DRUG$ dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily @DRUG$.
356	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
357	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$, or metoclopramide.
358	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
359	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
360	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
361	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
362	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
363	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
364	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as troleandomycin and @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
365	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
366	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
367	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
368	DDI-advise	- Drugs with ototoxic potential: Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered @DRUG$ in patients to whom @DRUG$ are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.
369	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including Solganal and @DRUG$.
370	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
371	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
372	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
373	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
374	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
375	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
376	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
377	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
378	DDI-mechanism	Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (etodolac capsules and tablets) results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin.
379	DDI-mechanism	Sulindac: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.
380	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
381	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
382	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of S(-) warfarin and @DRUG$, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
383	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.

385	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
386	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
387	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
388	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
389	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
390	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.
391	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
392	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
393	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
394	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
395	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.
396	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
397	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
398	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
