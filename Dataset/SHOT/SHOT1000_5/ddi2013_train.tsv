1218	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1219	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
1220	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
1221	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients on @DRUG$ should be observed when @DRUG$ Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
1222	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
1223	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
1224	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1225	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
1226	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
1227	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, @DRUG$, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
1228	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
1229	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
1230	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
1231	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
1232	DDI-effect	CNS-Active Drugs Ethanol: @DRUG$ 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of @DRUG$ 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after ethanol administration.
1233	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$ ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
1234	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1235	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with @DRUG$ overdosage or in those taking methotrexate.
1236	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
1237	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives.
1238	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
1239	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1240	DDI-mechanism	Acetaminophen: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen.
1241	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
1242	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
1243	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, methotrexate, or @DRUG$ may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
1244	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
1245	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of @DRUG$, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone.
1246	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
1247	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
1248	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
1249	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
1250	DDI-effect	If a @DRUG$ is also used, it may increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
1251	DDI-effect	Hypotension, AV conduction disturbances, and left ventricular failure have been reported in some patients receiving @DRUG$ when an oral @DRUG$ was added to the treatment regimen.
1252	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: @DRUG$, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1253	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1254	DDI-effect	Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$ or enalaprilat.
1255	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, @DRUG$, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
1256	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
1257	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
1258	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
1259	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
1260	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines, or @DRUG$.
1261	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
1262	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, @DRUG$, metoclopramide, pimozide.
1263	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1265	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of @DRUG$ (or rifabutin) and @DRUG$.
1266	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
1267	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
1268	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and @DRUG$, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1269	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and @DRUG$, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
1270	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1271	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1275	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1276	DDI-effect	Doxorubicin: @DRUG$ caused a decrease in @DRUG$ phosphorylation ( 50% inhibition of total phosphate formation) in U937/Molt 4 cells.
1277	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1278	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
1279	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
1280	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including @DRUG$, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
1281	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1282	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
1283	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
1284	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
1285	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as @DRUG$) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1286	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1287	DDI-effect	Patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
1288	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1289	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
1290	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
1291	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
1292	DDI-effect	- Antidiabetics, oral (diabetes medicine you take by mouth) Use of oral @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the blood and/or the side effects or oral antidiabetics
1293	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1294	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, @DRUG$, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

1297	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general @DRUG$) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
1298	DDI-effect	Use with Angiotensln Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: The use of @DRUG$ to control hypertension in patients on @DRUG$ has been reported to induce severe leukopenia.
1299	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1300	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
1301	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
1302	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with @DRUG$, Innovar Vet, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
1303	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
1304	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: @DRUG$ enhances the effect of warfarin.
1305	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1306	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
1307	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1308	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
1309	DDI-effect	Adrenergic blockers @DRUG$ are inhibited by @DRUG$.
1310	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
1311	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
1312	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.Cimetidine, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased altretamines half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
1313	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
1314	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1315	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
1316	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1317	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: @DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125mg with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and Aprepitant when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
1318	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
1319	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
1320	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.
1321	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
1322	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
1323	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1324	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., @DRUG$).
1325	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
1326	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
1327	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1328	DDI-effect	Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals.
1329	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
1330	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients taking @DRUG$, because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
1331	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
1332	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
1333	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1334	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1335	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either @DRUG$ or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
1336	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
1337	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like @DRUG$ (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
1338	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
1339	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
1340	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, @DRUG$, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
1341	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to ACE inhibitors and @DRUG$ increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).

1471	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, @DRUG$, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1472	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
1473	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
1474	DDI-mechanism	In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between @DRUG$ (a benzodiazepine) and @DRUG$ under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product.
1475	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with @DRUG$ therapy.
1476	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
1477	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1478	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and @DRUG$, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1479	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
1480	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
1481	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
1482	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$ analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
1483	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and @DRUG$ and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
1484	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
1485	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
1486	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
1487	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
1488	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of @DRUG$ bioavailability.
1489	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, @DRUG$, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1490	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in @DRUG$.
1491	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$, phenobarbital, phenytoin).
1492	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
1493	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1494	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
1495	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
1496	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
1497	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1498	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and @DRUG$, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
1499	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an 82% decrease in nelfinavir plasma A.C.
1500	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
1501	DDI-mechanism	However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either @DRUG$ 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of theophylline (@DRUG$ , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.
1502	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including @DRUG$ and Myochrysine.
1503	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1504	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

1506	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that @DRUG$, itraconazole, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
1507	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
1508	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$s serum concentrations.
1509	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1510	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational anesthetics such as @DRUG$ are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
1511	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells, but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of @DRUG$ when both are added simultaneously.
1512	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
1513	DDI-effect	Phenothiazines - Taking @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ together may increase the risk of convulsions (seizures).
1514	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1515	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or with other anticholinesterase agents.
1516	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 152% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and very little change in ritonavir plasma A.C.
1517	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1518	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
1519	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by 50%.
1520	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: May decrease @DRUG$ anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors.
1521	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1522	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
1523	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
1524	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
1525	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
1526	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
1527	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
1528	DDI-effect	Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: @DRUG$ can attenuate potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
1529	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
1530	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
1531	DDI-advise	Oral Anticoagulants CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN @DRUG$ ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH @DRUG$.
1532	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1533	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1534	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
1535	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1536	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
1537	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ sometimes proves to be fatal when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1538	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
1539	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
1540	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1541	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
1542	DDI-effect	Aminoglutethimide: @DRUG$ may diminish adrenal suppression by @DRUG$.
1543	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-@DRUG$, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
1544	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (@DRUG$, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1545	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, nicotine, and @DRUG$ may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
1546	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, opiates, and alcohol.
1547	DDI-advise	All @DRUG$ should be used cautiously in patients taking @DRUG$.
1548	DDI-effect	Aminoglycosides: The mixing of @DRUG$ with an @DRUG$ in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.
1549	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
1550	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, @DRUG$ like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
1551	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1552	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
1553	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
1554	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1555	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
1556	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
1557	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1558	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1559	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1560	DDI-effect	Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the @DRUG$ of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of @DRUG$, it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly.
1561	DDI-effect	There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1562	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1563	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1564	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (Depen, @DRUG$), another arthritis medication.
1565	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
1566	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that @DRUG$ like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
1567	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1568	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with @DRUG$ or fluoxetine, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
1569	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$.
1570	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
1571	DDI-effect	In common with other @DRUG$, AUGMENTIN XR may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$
1572	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
1573	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either amiodarone or @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
1574	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145 mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
1575	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
1576	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other @DRUG$ such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
1577	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
1578	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
1579	DDI-advise	Because @DRUG$ have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on @DRUG$ therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
1580	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or iodine excess may decrease the effect of @DRUG$, and an iodine deficiency can increase the effect of Carbimazole.
1581	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
1582	DDI-effect	The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.
1583	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium/@DRUG$-containing antacids.
1584	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1585	DDI-effect	Hyperpyrexia has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
1586	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
1587	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1588	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
1589	DDI-int	Thus, the interaction observed between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not expected for dirithromycin.
1590	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, @DRUG$, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
1591	DDI-mechanism	In addition, several @DRUG$ s that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and MHD.
1592	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1593	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1594	DDI-effect	Sildenafil citrate - Theoretically, @DRUG$ supplements taken concomitantly with @DRUG$, may potentiate the effects of the drug.
1595	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
1596	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other @DRUG$, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
1597	DDI-effect	However, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (5-7.5 mg initial oral dose followed by 2.5-6 mg/day orally for 6-10 days) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR).
1598	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic @DRUG$.It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with ALPHAGAN P in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect.
1599	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as @DRUG$ and metoprolol.
1600	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, @DRUG$, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
1601	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
1602	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1603	DDI-advise	These increased exposures of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol should be taken into consideration when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for women taking @DRUG$.
1604	DDI-advise	Thus, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided.
1605	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1606	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used together.
1607	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (MAOIs).
1608	DDI-effect	Phenothiazines and @DRUG$ may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
1609	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
1610	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
1611	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1612	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
1613	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen.
1614	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either @DRUG$ or minocycline.
1615	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
1616	DDI-effect	Adrenergic blockers: @DRUG$ are inhibited by @DRUG$.
1617	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of @DRUG$ and its synergism with cAMP, whereas it had no effect on histamine- or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min.
1618	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1619	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1620	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1621	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1622	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1623	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
1624	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
1625	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
1626	DDI-advise	In the case that you are taking @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, higher doses of digoxin may be needed.
1627	DDI-advise	If these agents are to be administered concurrently, @DRUG$ concentrations should be monitored, especially when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.
1628	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and tramadol (@DRUG$).
1629	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.
1630	DDI-effect	Although this effect was noted even when @DRUG$ was given 4 hours prior to @DRUG$, this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy.
1631	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
1632	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
1633	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1634	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
1635	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
1636	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., @DRUG$), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1637	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: When multiple doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%.
1638	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1639	DDI-advise	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made.
1640	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with ENBREL  alone (0%).
1641	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, @DRUG$(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1642	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase slightly the effect of antihypertensive drugs, e.g., guanethidine, @DRUG$, reserpine.
1643	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1644	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1645	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
1646	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, @DRUG$ chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1647	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
1648	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
1649	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., @DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1650	DDI-effect	Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals.
1651	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
1652	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (@DRUG$), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
1653	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1654	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1655	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1656	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1657	DDI-mechanism	Chronic administration of @DRUG$, a known enzyme inducer, may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of @DRUG$.
1658	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
1659	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
1660	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
1661	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with @DRUG$ (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
1662	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other @DRUG$.
1663	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, @DRUG$, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1664	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$ salts and digoxin).
1665	DDI-effect	In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1666	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
1667	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
1668	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, @DRUG$, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1669	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (@DRUG$), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1670	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other @DRUG$.
1671	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
1672	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
1673	DDI-effect	ACE-inhibitors:Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1674	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing @DRUG$, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1675	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1676	DDI-effect	"In monkeys, the effects of @DRUG$, but not (+)-NANM or PCP, were antagonized by @DRUG$;"
1677	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other @DRUG$ cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
1678	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of naloxone at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin, and a high dose of @DRUG$ (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ (16 micrograms).
1679	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1680	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
1681	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as @DRUG$, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1682	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and @DRUG$;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1683	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the effects of other @DRUG$.
1684	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, @DRUG$ (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1685	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (@DRUG$, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
1686	DDI-effect	Coingestion of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
1687	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1688	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ decreased the maximum plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.
1689	DDI-mechanism	"In a ten-subject study, coadministration of @DRUG$ (120 mg bid) with @DRUG$ resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;"
1690	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
1691	DDI-advise	Patients who are applying @DRUG$ gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET (N, @DRUG$), a common component of insect repellent products.
1692	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
1693	DDI-mechanism	Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
1694	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1695	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1696	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
1697	DDI-mechanism	High-dose @DRUG$ resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral @DRUG$ has led to an 80% increase in etoposide exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of etoposide compared to etoposide alone.
1698	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other @DRUG$, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1699	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some @DRUG$.
1700	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as @DRUG$ and erythromycin with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
1701	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other @DRUG$.
1702	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1703	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with @DRUG$ and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1704	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (@DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc).
1705	DDI-effect	Synergism between @DRUG$ (e.g., theophylline), ephedrine, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
1706	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
1707	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be coadministered.
1708	DDI-mechanism	The clearance of @DRUG$ may be increased with concurrent use of @DRUG$.
1709	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
1710	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure of @DRUG$ (10 mg BID) was increased by 28% following administration of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID) for 12 days, while plasma exposure of valdecoxib (40 mg BID) was not substantially increased following administration of diazepam (10 mg BID) for 12 days.
1711	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, @DRUG$, and sertraline.
1712	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
1713	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
1714	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that @DRUG$, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN.
1715	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
1716	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
1717	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
1718	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
1719	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines (e.g., @DRUG$ or diazepam) are additive.
1720	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1721	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
1722	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
1723	DDI-effect	Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of @DRUG$ to treat strongyloidiasis during the @DRUG$ cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
1724	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
1725	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
1726	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
1727	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
1728	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
1729	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., @DRUG$), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
1730	DDI-effect	At 75% recovery of fade, hoof twitch was 87 +/- 3% for atracurium alone and 82 +/- 4% for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
1731	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and @DRUG$.
1732	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
1733	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1734	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
1735	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (@DRUG$, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1736	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
1737	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
1738	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: @DRUG$ increases the effect of @DRUG$
1739	DDI-advise	It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ containing antacids for at least 4 hours following ethambutol administration.
1740	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
1741	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and @DRUG$ may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
1742	DDI-advise	"Patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored;"
1743	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (another TNF -blocking agent) and @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
1744	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
1745	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1746	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
1747	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
1748	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
1749	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
1750	DDI-effect	The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of @DRUG$ is antagonized by @DRUG$.
1751	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.
1752	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
1753	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
1754	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, thiothixene, @DRUG$).
1755	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
1756	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ including INDOCIN has been reported.
1757	DDI-mechanism	Repeated doses of @DRUG$ given prior to a single dose of @DRUG$ in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption.
1758	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants and the muscle relaxant effects of @DRUG$.
1759	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including @DRUG$, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
1760	DDI-advise	Therefore, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated, and alternative hypoglycemic agents should be considered.
1761	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
1762	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1763	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1764	DDI-effect	Exaggerated hypertensive responses have been reported from the combined use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including those contained in proprietary cold remedies and vasoconstrictive nasal drops.
1765	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1766	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
1767	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1768	DDI-effect	Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with @DRUG$, to which @DRUG$ was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either ENBREL CI or sulfasalazine alone.
1769	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both @DRUG$ and T3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
1770	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
1771	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
1772	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
1773	DDI-effect	Exogenous @DRUG$ also appeared to influence the percentage of @DRUG$-induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner.
1774	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when @DRUG$ and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
1775	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1776	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes (P = .005); this was prevented by @DRUG$ (P = .004)."
1777	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in @DRUG$metabolism.
1778	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
1779	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, warfarin, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
1780	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
1781	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other @DRUG$, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1782	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
1783	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
1784	DDI-mechanism	After the coadministration of 200 mg oral @DRUG$ twice daily and one 20 mg dose of @DRUG$ to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (  142 S.D.) and 251% (  68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo.
1785	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
1786	DDI-effect	The onset of neuromuscular blockade by @DRUG$ was unaffected by @DRUG$, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
1787	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
1788	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1789	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., @DRUG$;"
1790	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
1791	DDI-advise	If these agents are to be administered concurrently, @DRUG$ concentrations should be monitored, especially when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.
1792	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
1793	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1794	DDI-effect	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1795	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
1796	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1797	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and @DRUG$ (ACTH): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
1798	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
1799	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1800	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1801	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
1802	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, @DRUG$, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1803	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Diclofenac and other @DRUG$ can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
1804	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.
1805	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as @DRUG$ (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
1806	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, Innovar Vet, or @DRUG$, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
1807	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
1808	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1809	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1810	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, @DRUG$, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
1811	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, @DRUG$, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
1812	DDI-advise	Therefore, when using doses of @DRUG$ greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of @DRUG$ may be required.
1813	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to be antagonistic to beta-lactam antibiotics, including @DRUG$, based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli.
1814	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
1815	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
1816	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1817	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
1818	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (@DRUG$ such as ranitidine or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
1819	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1820	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
1821	DDI-effect	Animal studies indicate that @DRUG$ may be ineffective if the patient has recently received a @DRUG$.
1822	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
1823	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
1824	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ or calcium channel blockers and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
1825	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1826	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
1827	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate @DRUG$- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
1828	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
1829	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or @DRUG$-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
1830	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and @DRUG$ (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
1831	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1832	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING @DRUG$ AND ITS CONGENERS.
1833	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
1834	DDI-mechanism	MAO inhibitors @DRUG$, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow @DRUG$ metabolism.
1835	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1836	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1837	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
1838	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
1839	DDI-advise	@DRUG$: generally should not be given with @DRUG$.
1840	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1841	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
1842	DDI-mechanism	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Coadministration of @DRUG$ resulted in a 27% decrease in @DRUG$ clearance and an increase in Cmax of approximately 6%.
1843	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute @DRUG$ intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1844	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1845	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
1846	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1847	DDI-effect	When other @DRUG$ or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
1848	DDI-effect	Glyburide: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with the sulfonylurea @DRUG$ has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.
1849	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin @DRUG$ midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1850	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
1851	DDI-effect	Flucytosine: while a synergistic relationship with @DRUG$ has been reported, concomitant use may increase the toxicity of @DRUG$ by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion.
1852	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: sertraline and @DRUG$.
1853	DDI-effect	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of @DRUG$.
1854	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
1855	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and nitrite in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that @DRUG$ may react with @DRUG$ in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
1856	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1857	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1858	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
1859	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
1860	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.

1862	DDI-advise	Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and @DRUG$ has been observed, it is not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
1863	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1864	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1865	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with benzodiazepines or @DRUG$.
1866	DDI-mechanism	Furthermore it has been proposed that @DRUG$ resulted In induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested @DRUG$ being converted to the toxic metabolites.
1867	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
1868	DDI-mechanism	The oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ is reduced by 60% with coadministration of @DRUG$.
1869	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
1870	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1871	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, @DRUG$, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.

1876	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
1877	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Because @DRUG$ can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of @DRUG$ including TRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.
1878	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, @DRUG$, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
1879	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: @DRUG$ Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride

1889	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another.
1890	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
1891	DDI-mechanism	This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.
1892	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).

1903	DDI-effect	This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity when @DRUG$ is withdrawn.
1904	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
1905	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.

2059	DDI-mechanism	"There was a small decrease in the clearance of @DRUG$ caused by a 400-mg dose of @DRUG$;"
2060	DDI-effect	In ewes given 40 mg of @DRUG$/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present.
2061	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
2062	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).

2069	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2070	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the clearance of chronic high dose @DRUG$.
2071	DDI-mechanism	Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol) may be increased when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used in combination.
2072	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
2073	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, @DRUG$, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2074	DDI-effect	When taken orally , @DRUG$ like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.

2078	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains.
2079	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
2080	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.

2085	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
2086	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
2087	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$ therapy

2091	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
2092	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
2093	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.

2109	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
2110	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, @DRUG$ (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2111	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
2112	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.

2117	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$.
2118	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2119	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of @DRUG$ (300 m g/mL), the binding of @DRUG$ was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels.
2120	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2121	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
2122	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2123	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as @DRUG$, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2124	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
2125	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
2126	DDI-mechanism	Mineral Oil-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2127	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2128	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2129	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or @DRUG$ may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2130	DDI-effect	Because @DRUG$ may enhance the serotonergic effects of @DRUG$, caution should be exercised when LEXAPRO and lithium are coadministered.
2131	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
2132	DDI-advise	Carbamazepine: Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels @DRUG$ levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with @DRUG$, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
2133	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, @DRUG$ or warfarin.
2134	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
2135	DDI-effect	It was observed that @DRUG$ induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by @DRUG$ pretreatment.
2136	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving ampicillin or @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
2137	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2138	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2139	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2140	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), @DRUG$ and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2141	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
2142	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2143	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in @DRUG$ levels with @DRUG$ co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
2144	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as @DRUG$, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2145	DDI-effect	It is concluded that @DRUG$ is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with @DRUG$ would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system.
2146	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
2147	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes @DRUG$, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2148	DDI-effect	ERGAMISOL  (@DRUG$) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2149	DDI-effect	Co-administration: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, and other @DRUG$ may increase the risk of bleeding.
2150	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Elevated @DRUG$ levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
2151	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
2152	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
2153	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2154	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2155	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
2156	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2157	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2158	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or @DRUG$, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2159	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$s, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some @DRUG$ may result in severe hypertension.
2160	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2161	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
2162	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2163	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
2164	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., @DRUG$, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
2165	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
2166	DDI-effect	Injection of @DRUG$ 5 min before a nonlethal dose of @DRUG$ changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to endotoxin.
2167	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished binding of @DRUG$ by a net change of 9.9% (percentage increase in FDF, 21.2%) at 1732 micromol/L.
2168	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, @DRUG$, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2169	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
2170	DDI-effect	Medroxyprogesterone Acetate - @DRUG$ was observed to enhance (in tissue culture) the effect of @DRUG$ in reducing the number of human breast cancer cells that were in the S phase.
2171	DDI-effect	As the primary effect of @DRUG$ is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of @DRUG$.
2172	DDI-mechanism	Antacid (Maalox ): @DRUG$ reduced the bioavailability of @DRUG$ (N=16) by about 20%.
2173	DDI-effect	In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of @DRUG$-related toxicity when given supplemental @DRUG$ at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day.
2174	DDI-int	A two-way interaction between the @DRUG$, @DRUG$, and the coumarin anticoagulants has been suggested.
2175	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ can combine to cause dangerous hypertension.
2176	DDI-effect	Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or tuftsin.
2177	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ with potent @DRUG$ such as furosemide.
2178	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or @DRUG$ (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2179	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., @DRUG$, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
2180	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
2181	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.

2183	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is used with @DRUG$ in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur.
2184	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking @DRUG$ to whom @DRUG$ was administered.
2185	DDI-mechanism	Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy @DRUG$ intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
2186	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
2187	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
2188	DDI-effect	Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of @DRUG$ to treat strongyloidiasis during the @DRUG$ cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
2189	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that flurbiprofen like other @DRUG$, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
2190	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, @DRUG$, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2191	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2192	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with acetaminophen overdosage or in those taking @DRUG$.
2193	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2194	DDI-effect	Although beta-adrenergic blockers or @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
2195	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2196	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the @DRUG$ and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2197	DDI-effect	In these patients whose hypertension was controlled with @DRUG$, @DRUG$ 20 mg produced mean additional supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 6/5 mm Hg compared to placebo.
2198	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
2199	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2200	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as @DRUG$ or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
2201	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the dosage of warfarin should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time.
2202	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2203	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other @DRUG$, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2204	DDI-mechanism	In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving @DRUG$ or digoxin in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
2205	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
2206	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2207	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2208	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as @DRUG$, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
2209	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
2210	DDI-effect	Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$, including lisinopril.
2211	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain @DRUG$, etc.).
2212	DDI-effect	- In isolated cases, a pronounced though reversible, impairment of renal function (accompanied by a corresponding increase in the serum creatinine level) has been reported in organ transplant patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy and concomitant @DRUG$.
2213	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2214	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2215	DDI-advise	SUBUTEX and @DRUG$ should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
2216	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2217	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
2218	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other @DRUG$ have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
2219	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2220	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2221	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2222	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
2223	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2224	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
2225	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
2226	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
2227	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2228	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), @DRUG$, zileuton.
2229	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic or @DRUG$;"
2230	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and @DRUG$.
2231	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2232	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of @DRUG$.
2233	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace coumarin anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$, from their protein-binding sites.
2234	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and @DRUG$ can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
2235	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2236	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
2237	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
2238	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
2239	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
2240	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
2241	DDI-advise	Considerable caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with Phenurone (@DRUG$) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
2242	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
2243	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
2244	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
2245	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, @DRUG$, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
2246	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
2247	DDI-effect	Although this effect was noted even when @DRUG$ was given 4 hours prior to @DRUG$, this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy.
2248	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2249	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
2250	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, @DRUG$, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.

2389	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2390	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
2391	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and @DRUG$, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
2392	DDI-advise	Barbiturates and @DRUG$ should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
2393	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ diminishes the effect of coumarin and @DRUG$.
2394	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, @DRUG$, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2395	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2396	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
2397	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
2398	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2399	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
2400	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, @DRUG$, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2401	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2402	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, @DRUG$, including sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
2403	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
2404	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered with warfarin or its derivatives.
2405	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: @DRUG$
2406	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
2407	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
2408	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
2409	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
2410	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
2411	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2412	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, @DRUG$, iron salts and digoxin).
2413	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, @DRUG$, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
2414	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the zidovudine tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated @DRUG$ by 110%.
2415	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
2416	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of @DRUG$ and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
2417	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
2418	DDI-mechanism	In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg @DRUG$ and 12 g @DRUG$ resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
2419	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
2420	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2421	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2422	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2423	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
2424	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
2425	DDI-effect	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by @DRUG$ overdose with a positive @DRUG$ level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of carbamazepine with a toxicology screen for tricyclic antidepressants.
2426	DDI-mechanism	Human growth hormone - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome.
2427	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2428	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2429	DDI-effect	Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when @DRUG$ was administered to rats treated with @DRUG$ 8 hours before the ethanol challenge.
2430	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may not be effective due to decreased @DRUG$ concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.
2431	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
2432	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
2433	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and quinidine.
2434	DDI-mechanism	Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin) Racemic @DRUG$ exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant useof @DRUG$, a potent inducer of CYP3A4.
2435	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
2436	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ was applied to the muscle in the presence of @DRUG$, both first and second contractile responses to PTX were abolished.
2437	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
2438	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
2439	DDI-mechanism	Ibuprofen - @DRUG$ may increase the absorption of @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
2440	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2441	DDI-mechanism	However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of @DRUG$ nasal spray.
2442	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
2443	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, @DRUG$ (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.

2445	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2446	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2447	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, @DRUG$, trazodone

2455	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ because of the possibility of ototoxicity.
2456	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of @DRUG$ or pilocarpine;"
2457	DDI-effect	It is not known whether this potentiation of @DRUG$ rashes is due to @DRUG$ or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
2458	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
2459	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
2460	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when methylprednisolone was coadministered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on Days 2 and 3.
2461	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2462	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
2463	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (@DRUG$).
2464	DDI-effect	However, high doses of @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered @DRUG$.
2465	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral @DRUG$, warfarin, or its derivatives.
2466	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), @DRUG$, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2469	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
2470	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
2471	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2472	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ decreased the plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ by approximately 40%.

2474	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin, and @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2475	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2476	DDI-mechanism	The coadministration of @DRUG$ decreases the biologic half-life of @DRUG$ because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine.
2477	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
2478	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
2479	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.

2481	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, warfarin, @DRUG$ or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
2482	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2483	DDI-effect	Methotrexate - There is one report that @DRUG$ may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental @DRUG$ for chemotherapy-induced mucositis.
2484	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, @DRUG$ or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2485	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other @DRUG$) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2486	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other antidepressants, including @DRUG$, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
2487	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.

2519	DDI-effect	Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high-@DRUG$ rats were supersensitive to @DRUG$ when compared to vehicle-, progesterone- and progesterone + high-estradiol-treated rats (pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12, 7.21+/-0.13, 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18, respectively).
2520	DDI-mechanism	Extended Release Tablets: Administration of nifedipine with @DRUG$ increased @DRUG$ levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers.
2521	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
2522	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on the @DRUG$ requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of rifampin and extended a similar length of time after rifampin withdrawal.
2523	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2524	DDI-effect	- The action of @DRUG$ and insulin may be enhanced by @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
2525	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$, increasing the metabolism of chlorpromazine.
2526	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2527	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
2528	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), @DRUG$.
2529	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$ and losartan.
2530	DDI-effect	Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed @DRUG$ preparations (minipills that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during @DRUG$ therapy.
2531	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
2532	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and @DRUG$, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
2533	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ are given to patients receiving @DRUG$, hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crises, may occur.
2534	DDI-effect	Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2535	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
2536	DDI-effect	Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy.
2537	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
2538	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in clinical practice has been associated with increased anticoagulant effects.
2539	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
2540	DDI-advise	In patients receiving @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ concomitantly, any reduction in steroid dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden steroid withdrawal.
2541	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
2542	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, @DRUG$, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2543	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2544	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ and norepinephrine.
2545	DDI-advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their @DRUG$ dosage when @DRUG$ is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
2546	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or @DRUG$/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
2547	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), @DRUG$ (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2548	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2549	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
2550	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2551	DDI-mechanism	The serum estrogen concentrations of @DRUG$ + @DRUG$-treated rats decreased by 50%, while those of the endotoxin-treated rats increased (2- to 5-fold).
2552	DDI-effect	- The action of @DRUG$ and insulin may be enhanced by Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2553	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, @DRUG$ or warfarin.
2554	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2555	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
2556	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are reduced when given concurrently with @DRUG$.
2557	DDI-effect	The effects of concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on the PR interval were less than additive.
2558	DDI-mechanism	Studies in humans show that the absorption of @DRUG$ as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before @DRUG$.
2559	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
2560	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2561	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving @DRUG$ and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
2562	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2563	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2564	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2565	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2566	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine or @DRUG$) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
2567	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
2568	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2569	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2570	DDI-effect	The onset of neuromuscular blockade by @DRUG$ was unaffected by @DRUG$, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
2571	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
2572	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
2573	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2574	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, @DRUG$, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2575	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases lithium renal clearance and increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
2576	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2577	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
2578	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2579	DDI-mechanism	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg @DRUG$ was coadministered with each dose of @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg/day) in eight neurocysticercosis patients.
2580	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2581	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2582	DDI-effect	Two percent of patients treated concurrently with @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
2583	DDI-mechanism	Single doses of either @DRUG$ or colestipol resins bind the @DRUG$ and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
2584	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, @DRUG$, tolbutamide, trazodone
2585	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2586	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace @DRUG$s, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.
2587	DDI-effect	Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose (4 mg/kg/day) @DRUG$ group were supersensitive to @DRUG$ compared to the vehicle or low-dose (10 microg/kg/day) estradiol groups (pD2 values = 7.86+/-0.09, 7.30+/-0.11 and 7.35+/-0.04, respectively).
2588	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2589	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2590	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
2591	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of @DRUG$ and Penthrane (@DRUG$) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
2592	DDI-effect	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when @DRUG$ was administered with @DRUG$, the concomitant use of apomorphine with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2593	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2594	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and @DRUG$ (Ginkgo biloba).
2595	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates and other @DRUG$
2596	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
2597	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
2598	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2599	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2600	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
2601	DDI-effect	Antidiabetics: Because @DRUG$ may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of @DRUG$ may be required.
2602	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2603	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
2604	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either @DRUG$ or verapamil is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
2605	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2606	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concurrently increases @DRUG$ anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.
2607	DDI-effect	Clonidine: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may potentiate blood-pressure- and heart-rate-lowering effects.
2608	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
2609	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2610	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, @DRUG$, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
2611	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
2612	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, caffeine, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2613	DDI-advise	Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2614	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, @DRUG$, lovastatin, simvastatin).
2615	DDI-effect	Catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$, may have an additive effect when given with @DRUG$.
2616	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
2617	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer @DRUG$ did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.
2618	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2619	DDI-mechanism	or with multivitamins containing @DRUG$ may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue @DRUG$ concentrations.
2620	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
2621	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2622	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2623	DDI-effect	Thioridazine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
2624	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
2625	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate Renal tubular transport of @DRUG$ may be inhibited by concomitant administration of @DRUG$, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate.
2626	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2627	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2628	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
2629	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ toxicity may be aggravated by the initial release of norepinephrine caused by @DRUG$ Injection.
2630	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2631	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.

2634	DDI-advise	Microdosed minipill @DRUG$ preparations are not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
2635	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2636	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, @DRUG$ and mecamylamine.
2637	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as @DRUG$, spironolactone, and cimetidine.
2638	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2639	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
2640	DDI-mechanism	In two clinical studies, @DRUG$ (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by approximately 35%.
2641	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
2642	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of @DRUG$, including vitamin D preparations.
2643	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
2644	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2645	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and @DRUG$) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2646	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (for the treatment of hypotension related to obstetric blocks) and @DRUG$ may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.
2647	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2648	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both @DRUG$ and T3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.

2697	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
2698	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$ or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2699	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2700	DDI-mechanism	"Cyclosporine: Combination @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations;"

2706	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with @DRUG$ (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2707	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
2708	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, @DRUG$) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
2709	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or @DRUG$.
2710	DDI-mechanism	1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10% 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high Trileptal doses In vivo, the plasma levels of @DRUG$ increased by up to 40%, when @DRUG$ was given at doses above 1200 mg/day.

2718	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
2719	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2720	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2721	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ (equivalent to 145 mg TRICOR) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
2722	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
2723	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2724	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.

2728	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2729	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
2730	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.

2734	DDI-effect	- The action of sulphonylureas and @DRUG$ may be enhanced by @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
2735	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced @DRUG$ and iodamide excretion in chronic canine experiments.
2736	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.

2743	DDI-mechanism	Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$.
2744	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing @DRUG$, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2745	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, alcohol, and other @DRUG$.
2746	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with diuretics (such as @DRUG$) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

2750	DDI-effect	The vasodilating effects of @DRUG$ may be additive with those of other @DRUG$.
2751	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2752	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
2753	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2754	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium sparing, and @DRUG$.
2755	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2756	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2757	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
2758	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
2759	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2760	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2761	DDI-effect	There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2762	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
2763	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
2764	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral @DRUG$, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
2765	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
2766	DDI-advise	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
2767	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.

2876	DDI-mechanism	Ganciclovir: Administration of @DRUG$ 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral @DRUG$ was associated with a 111 (114)% increase in the steady-state AUC of didanosine (n = 12).
2877	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking @DRUG$, methotrexate, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
2878	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.

2885	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
2886	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2887	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
2888	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Accutane and tetracyclines should be avoided because @DRUG$ use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of @DRUG$
2889	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.

2913	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of @DRUG$ elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of Betaseron on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown.
2914	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2915	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2916	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the TNF antagonists alone.

2919	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
2920	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, @DRUG$) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2921	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2922	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, @DRUG$) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2923	DDI-mechanism	The increase of @DRUG$ level, however, is small (15%) when given with @DRUG$.
2924	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
2925	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients who are receiving @DRUG$ or monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs may result in an additive pressor effect .
2926	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
2927	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates or other sedatives.
2928	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, @DRUG$, and phenylbutazone.
2929	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
2930	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
2931	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.

2939	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an inhibitor of P450 2C9, decreased active metabolite concentration and increased @DRUG$ concentration.
2940	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2941	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, @DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2942	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2943	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of @DRUG$.
2944	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2945	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
2946	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ increases the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in a shortened elimination half-life of ZEBETA.
2947	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2948	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, @DRUG$, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
2949	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as @DRUG$, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

2951	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
2952	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, @DRUG$, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2953	DDI-effect	"In the presence of @DRUG$ (10(-5) M), @DRUG$ (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;"
2954	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of @DRUG$ was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with @DRUG$ compared to when it was given alone.
2955	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of @DRUG$, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
2956	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2957	DDI-effect	Using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (heart medicine) may cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat.
2958	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
2959	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2960	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
2961	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
2962	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2963	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and @DRUG$ may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
2964	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, and nifedipine.
2965	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.

2968	DDI-effect	In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone.
2969	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of @DRUG$ and its synergism with cAMP, whereas it had no effect on histamine- or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min.
2970	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
2971	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, @DRUG$, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2972	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with @DRUG$, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2973	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
2974	DDI-advise	Experience with co-administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and Fentanyl in patients is limited,therefore,consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2975	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2976	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
2977	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2978	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
2979	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may exacerbate the hypertensive response seen with @DRUG$ withdrawl.
2980	DDI-advise	Diazepam: The co-administration of @DRUG$ Tablets and @DRUG$ is generally not advisable.
2981	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2982	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
2983	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, @DRUG$, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2984	DDI-effect	When other potent parental @DRUG$, such as @DRUG$, are used in combination with hydralazine, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure.
2985	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2986	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, @DRUG$, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2987	DDI-effect	Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$, and it is possible that the administration of @DRUG$ as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
2988	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
2989	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2990	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
2991	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
2992	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2993	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
2994	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2995	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2996	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ increases both free and bound @DRUG$ by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
2997	DDI-effect	In one controlled clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including @DRUG$, were reported to prolong the action of @DRUG$.
2998	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, @DRUG$, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
2999	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$.

3001	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3002	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised during the administration of @DRUG$ to patients anaesthetised with @DRUG$ as arrhythmias may be precipitated.
3003	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ used concurrently increases the risk of renal calculus formation.
3004	DDI-effect	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$ and to increase the incidence of breakthrough bleeding.
3005	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3006	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3007	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
3008	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3009	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3010	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of @DRUG$.
3011	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3012	DDI-effect	Paclitaxel - In one report, @DRUG$ at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving @DRUG$, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
3013	DDI-effect	Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
3014	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
3015	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of @DRUG$.
3016	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3017	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
3018	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ doubled the AUC for @DRUG$.
3019	DDI-effect	Infusion requirements of NIMBEX in patients administered @DRUG$ prior to infusions of @DRUG$ were comparable to or slightly greater than when succinylcholine was not administered.
3020	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of loperamide and partly antagonized the effect of @DRUG$.
3021	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3022	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3023	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, @DRUG$, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3024	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor @DRUG$ (400 mg q.d. for 3 days) resulted in an approximately 60% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentrations of almotriptan.
3025	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3026	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3027	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3028	DDI-effect	Meperidine: @DRUG$ potentiate the analgesic effect of @DRUG$.
3029	DDI-effect	Glyburide: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with the @DRUG$ glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.
3030	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
3031	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (@DRUG$, thiothixene, alprazolam).
3032	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3033	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, @DRUG$), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3034	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and @DRUG$.
3035	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
3036	DDI-effect	Two of 16 subjects dosed simultaneously with @DRUG$ 10 mg and @DRUG$ 0.4 mg experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg.
3037	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3038	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3039	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduced the blood AUC0-12 of @DRUG$ by approximately 20%, peak blood concentration (Cmax) by 16%, and 12-hour blood concentration (C12hr) by 26% in healthy subjects when tacrolimus (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart) was administered on the 10th day of CANCIDAS 70 mg daily, as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone.
3040	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
3041	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
3042	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
3043	DDI-effect	The administration of local @DRUG$ containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$ or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
3044	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced.
3045	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, @DRUG$, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3046	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
3047	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), @DRUG$ (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3048	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of H1 and @DRUG$.
3049	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with diuretics, @DRUG$, or other vasodilators.
3050	DDI-effect	In common with other @DRUG$, AUGMENTIN XR may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$
3051	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3052	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3053	DDI-advise	Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for @DRUG$ when coadministered with @DRUG$.
3054	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
3055	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired in the presence of @DRUG$.
3056	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduces the clearance of @DRUG$.
3057	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
3058	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
3059	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, @DRUG$, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
3060	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3061	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
3062	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral @DRUG$.
3063	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, @DRUG$, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
3064	DDI-effect	Epidural @DRUG$ may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local @DRUG$, including both sensory and motor blockade.
3065	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
3066	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
3067	DDI-effect	Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3068	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, @DRUG$ or codeine.
3069	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, @DRUG$, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3070	DDI-mechanism	Leucovorin: The concentration of @DRUG$ is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by @DRUG$.
3071	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3072	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and @DRUG$.
3073	DDI-effect	(@DRUG$ may increase the responsiveness to @DRUG$.)
3074	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
3075	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
3076	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
3077	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3078	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, @DRUG$, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3079	DDI-mechanism	However, patients on @DRUG$ may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
3080	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
3081	DDI-effect	ETHANOL / NUTRITION / HERB INTERACTIONS: Food: CNS effects of caffeine may be enhanced if @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.

3084	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3085	DDI-effect	Ketamine: Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported in association with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3086	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: @DRUG$ and kaolin can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
3087	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: @DRUG$, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3088	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3089	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
3090	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with @DRUG$, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3091	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
3092	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates and other sedatives
3093	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, @DRUG$ and nefazadone) .
3094	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3095	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
3096	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
3097	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and Anticoagulants: Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3098	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
3099	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease @DRUG$ concentrations.
3100	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3101	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (@DRUG$), and voriconazole .
3102	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
3103	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
3104	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains.
3105	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may result in an increased risk of GI ulceration and complications compared to valdecoxib alone.
3106	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.

3108	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of @DRUG$.
3109	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
3110	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3111	DDI-advise	Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.
3112	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, haloperidol, @DRUG$, pimozide.
3113	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

3117	DDI-effect	However, another @DRUG$ has been found to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of @DRUG$.
3118	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), @DRUG$, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

3123	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block @DRUG$-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
3124	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has led to elevated plasma concentrations of terfenadine, resulting in rare instances of life- threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and one death.
3125	DDI-mechanism	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because @DRUG$ increases the rate of excretion of @DRUG$, the concomitant use of Nalfon and salicylates is not recommended.
3126	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.

3131	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3132	DDI-advise	Patients with major psychotic disorders, treated with @DRUG$, should be treated with @DRUG$ only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
3133	DDI-effect	In a similar study with tamsulosin in healthy volunteers, 1 of 24 subjects dosed with @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 0.4 mg separated by 6 hours experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg.

3137	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
3138	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3139	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.

3146	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: @DRUG$ and paroxetine.
3147	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3148	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, @DRUG$, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
3149	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
3150	DDI-effect	Warfarin-@DRUG$ can antagonize the effect of @DRUG$
3151	DDI-mechanism	Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that @DRUG$ and erythromycin significantly increased the systemic exposure of @DRUG$ and/or its major metabolites.
3152	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
3153	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ usually depresses @DRUG$ activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
3154	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
3155	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
3156	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
3157	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
3158	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3159	DDI-advise	Based on the chemical resemblance of itraconazole and ketoconazole, coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.

3161	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: @DRUG$ (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3162	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3163	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3164	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
3165	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, @DRUG$ (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3168	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3169	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
3170	DDI-effect	The successive application of @DRUG$ (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
3171	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
3172	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.

3186	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
3187	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
3188	DDI-mechanism	Bismuth: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$ or 60 minutes following enoxacin administration, decreased enoxacin bioavailability by approximately 25%.
3189	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

3201	DDI-mechanism	Oral doses of @DRUG$ (10-20 mg/kg), via alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition, significantly reduced the rate of elimination of @DRUG$ (by approximately 40%) given to healthy volunteers in moderate doses.
3202	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if @DRUG$ and/or narcotics are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
3203	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when @DRUG$ and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
3204	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.

3279	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
3280	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3281	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3282	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ should receive 70 mg of @DRUG$ daily.
3283	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as @DRUG$) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
3284	DDI-effect	There are case reports of patients who developed increased BUN, serum creatinine and serum potassium levels, and weight gain when @DRUG$ was used in conjunction with @DRUG$.
3285	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or @DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3286	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and @DRUG$.
3287	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
3288	DDI-effect	Alcohol: In post-marketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$.
3289	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
3290	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, @DRUG$, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3291	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, @DRUG$, alprazolam).
3292	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
3293	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
3294	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
3295	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
3296	DDI-effect	Imidazoles (e. g., ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, etc.): in vitro and animal studies with the combination of amphotericin B and imidazoles suggest that @DRUG$ may induce fungal resistance to @DRUG$.
3297	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3298	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase slightly the effect of antihypertensive drugs, e.g., @DRUG$, methyldopa, reserpine.
3299	DDI-effect	In post-marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3300	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3301	DDI-effect	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may render these contraceptives less effective.
3302	DDI-mechanism	Plasma levels of @DRUG$ may become subtherapeutic during @DRUG$ therapy.
3303	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
3304	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3305	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents.
3306	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3307	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ supplements and @DRUG$ may increase calcium absorption
3308	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
3309	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;@DRUG$;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3310	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in @DRUG$ serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to lithium alone.
3311	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as troleandomycin and @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
3312	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3313	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
3314	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or @DRUG$ and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
3315	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3316	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, @DRUG$) should be considered.
3317	DDI-effect	The potential for increased sedation when @DRUG$ is given with other @DRUG$ should be appreciated.
3318	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: @DRUG$ may raise serum @DRUG$ levels in some individuals.
3319	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
3320	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3321	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, @DRUG$ Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3322	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
3323	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
3324	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving cyclopropane or @DRUG$.
3325	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decreased the hyperuricemic effect of @DRUG$.
3326	DDI-effect	Patients receiving high doses of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites.
3327	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
3328	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, @DRUG$, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
3329	DDI-effect	Tolazamide: A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on @DRUG$ (1 gm/day) 11 days after the addition of @DRUG$ (75 mg/day).
3330	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
3331	DDI-mechanism	Use with Allopurinol: The principal pathway for detoxification of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
3332	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, @DRUG$ and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
3333	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3334	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3335	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3336	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and @DRUG$;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3337	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
3338	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ have been shown to reduce @DRUG$-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension seen with PROLEUKIN.
3339	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, @DRUG$, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3340	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3341	DDI-mechanism	Verapamil: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in a 24% increase in plasma concentrations of almotriptan.
3342	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3343	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3344	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
3345	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
3346	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
3347	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
3348	DDI-mechanism	Trough plasma enoxacin levels were also 20% higher when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were administered concomitantly.
3349	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
3350	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
3351	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
3352	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives @DRUG$: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3353	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3354	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3355	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
3356	DDI-advise	Based on these data, @DRUG$ should not be used in patients on @DRUG$ therapy.
3357	DDI-effect	Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents: Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina.
3358	DDI-effect	There have been reports of theophylline-related side effects in patients on concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3359	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and @DRUG$ can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
3360	DDI-effect	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3361	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of adenosine may be required or @DRUG$ may not be effective.
3362	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease emetic response to @DRUG$.
3363	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3364	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of @DRUG$ and azathioprine to 6-thiouric acid.
3365	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
3366	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3367	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of @DRUG$ and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3368	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: @DRUG$ (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3369	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including @DRUG$, tranquilizers, and alcohol.
3370	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
3371	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
3372	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse (@DRUG$, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
3373	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3374	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3375	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy: Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by @DRUG$ used in methenamine therapy.
3376	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
3377	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary.
3378	DDI-advise	Lithium serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3379	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
3380	DDI-advise	These results would seem to dictate against the clinical use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, or during the period following ELSPAR therapy when plasma asparagine levels are below normal.
3381	DDI-effect	- Methotrexate (e.g., Mexate) Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the liver and/or the side effects of methotrexate
3382	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
3383	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3384	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
3385	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3386	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
3387	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
3388	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$ and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3389	DDI-advise	For example, when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
3390	DDI-effect	At 75% recovery of fade, hoof twitch was 87 +/- 3% for atracurium alone and 82 +/- 4% for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
3391	DDI-mechanism	Interactions of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in absorption and retention.
3392	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3393	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or @DRUG$ in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
3394	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3395	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
3396	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
3397	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3398	DDI-effect	The administration of local @DRUG$ containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
3399	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as @DRUG$) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
3400	DDI-effect	Cholinesterase Inhibitors: @DRUG$ may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of @DRUG$, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
3401	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3402	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with allopurinol (100 mg/kg, ip) or @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
3403	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
3404	DDI-effect	In ewes given 40 mg of @DRUG$/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present.
3405	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with HEXALEN and/or @DRUG$.1
3406	DDI-mechanism	Clofibric acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3407	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.

3411	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
3412	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3413	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.

3416	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
3417	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
3418	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
3419	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant use of some @DRUG$.
3420	DDI-effect	The treatment of ewes with an intravenous (IV) injection of @DRUG$, insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg/day.
3421	DDI-effect	Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril or @DRUG$.

3431	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3432	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, @DRUG$, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
3433	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
3434	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, @DRUG$, netilmicin, or tobramycin.

3454	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
3455	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
3456	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
3457	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of @DRUG$ to subjects receiving multiple doses of @DRUG$, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone.
3458	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3459	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3460	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in @DRUG$ therapy.
3461	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3462	DDI-mechanism	Saquinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with @DRUG$ resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
3463	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline .
3464	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
3465	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - @DRUG$ or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3466	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
3467	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3468	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ steady-state Cmax, A.C. and Cmin were increased 21%, decreased 19%, and decreased 48%, respectively, by concomitant @DRUG$.

3471	DDI-mechanism	Rifabutin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in a 32% decrease in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 207% increase in rifabutin plasma A.C.
3472	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3473	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3474	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
3475	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, co-administration of probenecid with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
3476	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
3477	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
3478	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
3479	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
3480	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing @DRUG$, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3481	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as @DRUG$, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
3482	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3483	DDI-mechanism	The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$, a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9.
3484	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3485	DDI-mechanism	Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ AUC by about 2/3.
3486	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3487	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: @DRUG$  is not recommended for use in patients who have received @DRUG$ within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics
3488	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3489	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (@DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3490	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3491	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ 1/35  increased the exposure of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 20% and 34%, respectively.
3492	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3493	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3494	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.
3495	DDI-mechanism	A drug-drug interaction study with @DRUG$ in healthy volunteers has shown a 30% decrease in @DRUG$ trough concentrations.
3496	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3497	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3498	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3499	DDI-advise	Adequate monitoring of theophylline plasma concentrations should be considered when therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated or changed in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3500	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3501	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in 50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations.
3502	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
3503	DDI-mechanism	Based on total @DRUG$ concentrations, @DRUG$ increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
3504	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3505	DDI-advise	- Drugs with ototoxic potential: Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered @DRUG$ in patients to whom @DRUG$ are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.
3506	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [@DRUG$] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3507	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may elevate @DRUG$ levels.
3508	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3509	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3510	DDI-advise	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3511	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, @DRUG$, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3512	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain @DRUG$, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3513	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3514	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
3515	DDI-mechanism	By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, @DRUG$ may decrease serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect.
3516	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: @DRUG$, including enoxacin, decrease the clearance of @DRUG$, the less active isomer of racemic warfarin.
3517	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3518	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (@DRUG$, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3519	DDI-mechanism	Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of @DRUG$ in anhydrous and aqueous @DRUG$ solutions.
3520	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
3521	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, @DRUG$, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
3522	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: May decrease renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
3523	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
3524	DDI-mechanism	In patients given very high doses (3900 mg) of @DRUG$ daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when @DRUG$, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.
3525	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3526	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
3527	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate @DRUG$ Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
3528	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3529	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, @DRUG$, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3530	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
3531	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3532	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
3533	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3534	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3535	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
3536	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3537	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
3538	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3539	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, @DRUG$ inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3540	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3541	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
3542	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3543	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3544	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3545	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3546	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3547	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and @DRUG$) is contraindicated .
3548	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of @DRUG$, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
3549	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
3550	DDI-mechanism	Phenylbutazone: @DRUG$ causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of @DRUG$.
3551	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3552	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of @DRUG$ increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.
3553	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: @DRUG$, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3554	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3555	DDI-mechanism	"Cyclosporine: Combination @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations;"
3556	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3557	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), @DRUG$ (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3558	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
3559	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: Altered serum levels of @DRUG$ (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$.
3560	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3561	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
3562	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Demonstrated to be CYP 3A Inhibitors of Possible Clinical Significance on the Basis of Clinical Studies Involving Alprazolam (caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam): Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 21%, increased half-life by 17%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.
3563	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
3564	DDI-mechanism	This antagonistic effect of @DRUG$ on @DRUG$ natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide.
3565	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
3566	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium/aluminum-containing @DRUG$.
3567	DDI-mechanism	"Oral contraceptives: @DRUG$, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of @DRUG$ and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43%, and decreased the AUC of norethindrone by 8%;"
3568	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3569	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
3570	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3571	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3572	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3573	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, @DRUG$, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
3574	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3575	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
3576	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3577	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving @DRUG$, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary.
3578	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
3579	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, @DRUG$, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3580	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3581	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
3582	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., @DRUG$, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3583	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
3584	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
3585	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
3586	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, @DRUG$, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3587	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3588	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3589	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with @DRUG$ (10 mg/kg/day) (n=7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n=12).
3590	DDI-advise	Patients who have been treated with @DRUG$ within two to three weeks prior to the administration of @DRUG$ should receive initial doses of dopamine HCl no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
3591	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have been reported to increase steadystate plasma @DRUG$ levels.
3592	DDI-mechanism	ERYTHROMYCIN: In hypercholesterolemic patients, steady-state @DRUG$ AUC and Cmax increased approximately 50% and 24% respectively after 10 days with co-administration of @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
3593	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
3594	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.
3595	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
3596	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3597	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3598	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3599	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3600	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3601	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3602	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3603	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
3604	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, @DRUG$, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3605	DDI-mechanism	These alterations in @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics produced by @DRUG$ explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
3606	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
3607	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3608	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
3609	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
3610	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3611	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some @DRUG$.
3612	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3613	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3614	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3615	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3616	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), @DRUG$ (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3617	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
3618	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ renal clearance and increases lithium plasma levels.
3619	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
3620	DDI-mechanism	Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and @DRUG$.
3621	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
3622	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, @DRUG$ and 5-fluorouracil.
3623	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3624	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
3625	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3626	DDI-mechanism	Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC by 2/3.
3627	DDI-mechanism	In a single subject given one dose of @DRUG$ 2 hours after a dose of @DRUG$-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.
3628	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
3629	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
3630	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
3631	DDI-advise	Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3632	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
3633	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased @DRUG$ exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.
3634	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3635	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ (equivalent to 145mg TRICOR) with @DRUG$ (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.
3636	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased @DRUG$ exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.
3637	DDI-mechanism	"Potential for reduction in @DRUG$ and/or @DRUG$ plasma levels;"
3638	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), @DRUG$ (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3639	DDI-advise	Theophylline serum levels should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments considered for patients given both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3640	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$ causes a slight decrease (about 10%) in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3641	DDI-mechanism	Resins: Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take @DRUG$ at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption.
3642	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with Bezalip or @DRUG$ retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3643	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., @DRUG$).
3644	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3645	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
3646	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3647	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
3648	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, @DRUG$, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
3649	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
3650	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
3651	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
3652	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
3653	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3654	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3655	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3656	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), @DRUG$ (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3657	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine
3658	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3659	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
3660	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the plasma levels of @DRUG$, if given concomitantly.
3661	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
3662	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
3663	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, @DRUG$ or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3664	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
3665	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
3666	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
3667	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine resin may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation, The discontinuance of @DRUG$ resin could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as @DRUG$ has been filtrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking cholestyramine resin.
3668	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3669	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3670	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption .
3671	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, @DRUG$, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3672	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3673	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3674	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3675	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as ketoconazole and @DRUG$ should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
3676	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
3677	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, @DRUG$, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3678	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
3679	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
3680	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3681	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), @DRUG$ containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3682	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ are given in conjunction with @DRUG$.
3683	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
3684	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
3685	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3686	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3687	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3688	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, @DRUG$, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3689	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3690	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
3691	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3692	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3693	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
3694	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of @DRUG$, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
3695	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, @DRUG$, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3696	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ produced a 25% increase in AUC and a 33% increase in the Cmax of acamprosate.
3697	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the zidovudine tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated @DRUG$ by 110%.
3698	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3699	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
3700	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3701	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3702	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and @DRUG$] is contraindicated.
3703	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, @DRUG$ and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3704	DDI-mechanism	A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and AUC (53%) after a 1-week course of @DRUG$ 1200 mg/day and a single dose of @DRUG$ 60mg.
3705	DDI-mechanism	The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day.
3706	DDI-mechanism	Metoclopramide: Bioavailability is mildly reduced (approximately 10%) when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3707	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with @DRUG$
3708	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
3709	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as @DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3710	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, @DRUG$, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3711	DDI-advise	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because aspirin increases the rate of excretion of Nalfon, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3712	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including Solganal and @DRUG$.
3713	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3714	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
3715	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3716	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3717	DDI-mechanism	Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of @DRUG$ when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing @DRUG$.
3718	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3719	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
3720	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving @DRUG$ 450 mg BID with @DRUG$ 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.
3721	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3722	DDI-advise	Standard monitoring of methotrexate-related toxicity should be continued if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3723	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
3724	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3725	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3726	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3727	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3728	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3729	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3730	DDI-mechanism	This effect may be mediated by the ability of @DRUG$ to induce microsomal enzymes and, thus, the catabolism of @DRUG$.
3731	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
3732	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the @DRUG$ and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
3733	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
3734	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
3735	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3736	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3737	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
3738	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3739	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ modifies @DRUG$ metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin.
3740	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal Contraceptives, Including Oral, Injectable, Transdermal, and Implantable Contraceptives: An interaction study demonstrated that co-administration of @DRUG$ and the oral hormonal contraceptive @DRUG$ produced average decreases of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol levels of 14% and 31%, respectively.
3741	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
3742	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in 50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations.
3743	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3744	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
3745	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
3746	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
3747	DDI-mechanism	Additionally, higher than expected @DRUG$ levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking @DRUG$.
3748	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ritonavir, and @DRUG$) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
3749	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3750	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral @DRUG$ are given.
3751	DDI-mechanism	Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer @DRUG$ (600 mg every 24 hours, q24h, for 14 days), however, reduced @DRUG$ Cmax and AUC by approximately 80%.
3752	DDI-int	conversely, @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ (i.e., guanethidine, a-methyldopa).
3753	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
3754	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3755	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3756	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
3757	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3758	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
3759	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
3760	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3761	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
3762	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
3763	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3764	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3765	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: After introduction of @DRUG$ (oral form), a sudden increase in serum @DRUG$ level has been reported.
3766	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (@DRUG$ and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
3767	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ along with either oral or intravenous @DRUG$ should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension.
3768	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
3769	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, @DRUG$, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3770	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3771	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3772	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3773	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3774	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3775	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3776	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
3777	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
3778	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
3779	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3780	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3781	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3782	DDI-mechanism	Ethosuximide: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$.
3783	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
3784	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, @DRUG$, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3785	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
3786	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and @DRUG$ resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3787	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
3788	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3789	DDI-mechanism	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medicaoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or @DRUG$ in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
3790	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
3791	DDI-mechanism	At higher than recommended doses, @DRUG$ 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving @DRUG$ 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
3792	DDI-advise	Patients already stabilized on @DRUG$ should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with @DRUG$ coadministration.
3793	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3794	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
3795	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3796	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3797	DDI-advise	Following the administration of @DRUG$, the dose of other @DRUG$ should be reduced.
3798	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3799	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3800	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3801	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3802	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, @DRUG$, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3803	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3804	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
3805	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
3806	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3807	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3808	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3809	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3810	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, @DRUG$, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3811	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: @DRUG$ metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3812	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3813	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., @DRUG$, glycosides) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
3814	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, @DRUG$, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3815	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases.
3816	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, @DRUG$ resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3817	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, @DRUG$, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3818	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that @DRUG$, erythromycin, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3819	DDI-advise	Particular caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., cyclosporine or @DRUG$).
3820	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
3821	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
3822	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and cyclosporine, @DRUG$ or digoxin has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
3823	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
3824	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
3825	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
3826	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
3827	DDI-mechanism	When the @DRUG$ was administered 30 minutes after the @DRUG$ nasal spray, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and Cmax decreased 18%.
3828	DDI-mechanism	Metoprolol - Administration of 20 mg/day @DRUG$ for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50% increase in Cmax and 82% increase in AUC of the beta-adrenergic blocker @DRUG$ (given in a single dose of 100 mg).
3829	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
3830	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
3831	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3832	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3833	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
3834	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of @DRUG$ bioavailability.
3835	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, @DRUG$ chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3836	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3837	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, @DRUG$ and itraconazole) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
3838	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
3839	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: In controlled studies in healthy volunteers, @DRUG$ either had no effect (one study) or was associated with modest increases, about 30% (two studies) in steady-state serum @DRUG$ concentrations.
3840	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3841	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3842	DDI-advise	Patients receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.
3843	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3844	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
3845	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, @DRUG$(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3846	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3847	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, @DRUG$, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3848	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3849	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
3850	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
3851	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
3852	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3853	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
3854	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3855	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
3856	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
3857	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic @DRUG$, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3858	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3859	DDI-int	A potential interaction between oral @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
3860	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3861	DDI-advise	Therefore you may need to take a @DRUG$ supplement while taking @DRUG$.
3862	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., @DRUG$), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3863	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, @DRUG$, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3864	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3865	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3866	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3868	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any @DRUG$, including Solganal and Myochrysine.
3869	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.

4152	DDI-advise	The IV @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
4153	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
4154	DDI-advise	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
4155	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
4156	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
4157	DDI-advise	Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between TORADOL and warfarin or heparin, the administration of @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$ should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored.
4158	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
4159	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
4160	DDI-advise	Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing @DRUG$ therapy in patients receiving @DRUG$ or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.
4161	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ treatment should be closely monitored when @DRUG$ is introduced or withdrawn.
4162	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.

4181	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$.
4182	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
4183	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (@DRUG$, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
4184	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
4185	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
4186	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the @DRUG$ (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
4187	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

4189	DDI-advise	Concurrent therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
4190	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
4191	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, @DRUG$, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
4192	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
4193	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

4196	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
4197	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
4198	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
4199	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
