H(4)biopterin substituted at N(5) with @GENE$, hydroxymethyl, formyl and acetyl groups were used.
107	CPR:4	Interestingly, a @CHEMICAL$ mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with @GENE$-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency.

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.

134	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor @CHEMICAL$ could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an @GENE$ reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.

In the absence of @CHEMICAL$, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of @GENE$-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.

996	CPRFalse	Chronic insulin (24 h) activates @CHEMICAL$ through the classic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (PI3K-SGK1) pathway as insulin stimulates SGK1 phosphorylation and the insulin effect can be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor @GENE$ or a dominant-negative SGK1.

1068	CPR:9	The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic @CHEMICAL$ subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of @GENE$.
1069	CPR:3	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only @CHEMICAL$ did so independently of its activity at @GENE$, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 mM)."

1078	CPR:4	When further examined for its anticancer mechanism, @CHEMICAL$ effectively suppressed the @GENE$/mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo.
1079	CPRFalse	In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with @CHEMICAL$, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense @GENE$ (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus.
1080	CPRFalse	PURPOSE: To compare phenelzine (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (@CHEMICAL$), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of @GENE$, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (ALA-T).

1094	CPR:3	These results suggest that @CHEMICAL$, although identified as a 5-HT antagonist, acts as a 5-HT1 agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional @GENE$, located to sensory nerves.
1095	CPRFalse	These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of @CHEMICAL$ and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, @GENE$ and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.
1096	CPR:9	"We found that reduction of the carcinogenic hydroxylamines of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (@CHEMICAL$; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only @GENE$ and cyt b5."

1104	CPRFalse	Pretreatment of rats with the @CHEMICAL$ inhibitor tranylcypromine prevented the increase in brain GABA and @GENE$ levels with PLZ, but did not block the effect of VIG on GABA.

1108	CPRFalse	The action of @CHEMICAL$ does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an @GENE$ reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.

1128	CPR:3	Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of @CHEMICAL$ mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (@GENE$), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme.

Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (beta4Gal-T1) normally transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc in the presence of Mn(2+) ion (Gal-T activity) and also transfers Glc from UDP-Glc to GlcNAc (@GENE$-T activity), albeit at only 0.3% efficiency.

3887	CPR:6	In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with @CHEMICAL$, etomidate inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, @GENE$, with higher potency from alpha2B- and alpha2C-receptors than from alpha2A-receptors (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm).
3888	CPR:9	"We found that reduction of the carcinogenic @CHEMICAL$ of the aromatic amine 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP; found in cigarette smoke) and the heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only @GENE$ and cyt b5."
3889	CPR:3	@CHEMICAL$ exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mRNA expression for @GENE$ and PDE3A, but PDE4D gene expression was unchanged.
3890	CPR:3	The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting @CHEMICAL$-induced MAPK, JNK and @GENE$(MAPK) phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation.

3892	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ is a receptor that binds HDL with high affinity and mediates both the selective lipid uptake of cholesteryl esters from lipid-rich HDL to cells and the efflux of unesterified @GENE$ from cells to HDL.
3893	CPR:9	The enzyme @CHEMICAL$ (DDAH) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated @GENE$ residues to citrulline and methylamines.
3894	CPR:3	Both 5 alpha-NET and @CHEMICAL$ blocked the @GENE$ down-regulation induced by P4 as assessed by Western and Northern blot methods.
3895	CPR:6	In further studies, the diuretic effects of the CB1 agonist AM4054 were similar in male and female rats, displayed a relatively rapid onset to action, and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 minutes pretreatment with rimonabant, but not by the vanilloid receptor type I antagonist capsazepine, nor were the effects of WIN 55,212 antagonized by the @CHEMICAL$ antagonist AM630 [@GENE$].
