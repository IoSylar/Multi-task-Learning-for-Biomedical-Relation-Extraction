75	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
76	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by @DRUG$, such as propranolol and metoprolol.
77	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of @DRUG$ may be required or adenosine may not be effective.
78	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.

87	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
88	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, renal excretion of loracarbef is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
89	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.

104	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
105	DDI-mechanism	Even so @DRUG$ plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of @DRUG$ were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.
106	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
107	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
108	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
109	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
110	DDI-advise	Therefore when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ their dosage should be reduced.
111	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
112	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
113	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
114	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
115	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or @DRUG$, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
116	DDI-effect	Hypotension   Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of @DRUG$.
117	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
118	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
119	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
120	DDI-effect	Adrenergic Agents:Some individuals receiving @DRUG$ may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, @DRUG$ or dopaminergic agents.
121	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
122	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (@DRUG$, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
123	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$-containing minipill preparations.
124	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
125	DDI-advise	Methotrexate: Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
126	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
127	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
128	DDI-effect	Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
129	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased to approximately 3.6-fold of control and half-life increased to 1.7-fold of control.
130	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
131	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
132	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
133	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
134	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, @DRUG$, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
135	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
136	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
137	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
138	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
139	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
140	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
141	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
142	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
143	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
144	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
145	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
146	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
147	DDI-effect	Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., @DRUG$), ephedrine, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
148	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
149	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.

153	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
154	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
155	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
156	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
157	DDI-effect	Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the @DRUG$ are also additive to those of @DRUG$.

160	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
161	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and @DRUG$ and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
162	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
163	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
164	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic @DRUG$.
165	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
166	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
167	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and @DRUG$, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.

169	DDI-effect	It would be expected that @DRUG$ use during therapy with @DRUG$ would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.
170	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
171	DDI-effect	Phenytoin: Serum @DRUG$ levels may be increased by @DRUG$.
172	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.
173	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
174	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
175	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
176	DDI-effect	Non-selective MAO inhibitors including tranylcypromine sulfate, phenelzine sulfate, and pargyline HC1: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and non-selective @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
177	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.

189	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
190	DDI-advise	Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with @DRUG$ to extend the half-life of @DRUG$ is not recommended.
191	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
192	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.

195	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, the effects of @DRUG$ on travelers receiving comedication, particularly diabetics or patients using @DRUG$, should be checked before departure.
196	DDI-advise	Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of @DRUG$, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
197	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
198	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
199	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.

204	DDI-advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$.
205	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
206	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
207	DDI-advise	The benefits and risks of using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed
