3	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
4	DDI-false	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and @DRUG$ in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that @DRUG$ may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
5	DDI-false	Caution should be used when administering or taking TARCEVA with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .

16	DDI-false	Interactions with @DRUG$: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
17	DDI-false	When @DRUG$ was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of @DRUG$ increased 3-fold.
18	DDI-false	Dexbrompheniramine can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with @DRUG$ may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
19	DDI-false	However, co-administration of Duloxetine with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or @DRUG$ with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of @DRUG$ absorption after administration of a 40-mg oral dose.
20	DDI-false	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
21	DDI-false	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

24	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
25	DDI-false	Cholestyramine resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
26	DDI-false	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of IOPIDINE 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (@DRUG$, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, @DRUG$) should be considered.

35	DDI-false	Potential drug interactions between @DRUG$  and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these @DRUG$ during placebo-controlled clinical studies.
36	DDI-false	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was well tolerated.
37	DDI-false	Nabilone should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).

41	DDI-false	"Two groups (SH/DA; SH/FA) were submitted to daily treatment with synthetic hydroalcoholic solutions containing ethanol, methanol, higher @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the same proportions as those found in most common distilled and fermented alcoholic beverages;"
42	DDI-false	Erythromycin and @DRUG$ (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase digoxin absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
43	DDI-false	Digoxin - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day racemic @DRUG$, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or @DRUG$.
44	DDI-false	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and @DRUG$.
45	DDI-false	Lithium: Increased serum @DRUG$ levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ during therapy with lithium.
46	DDI-false	In patients in whom CYP3A4 inducers (eg, dexamethasone, phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampicin, @DRUG$) are indicated, alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential should be used.
47	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or with other anticholinesterase agents.
48	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of ascorbic acid (@DRUG$) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
49	DDI-false	Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of @DRUG$, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for @DRUG$ may be necessary.
50	DDI-false	To investigate the effects of antimicrobial combinations of GL with four kinds of @DRUG$ (ampicillin, cefazolin, @DRUG$ and chloramphenicol), the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was determined by checkerboard assay for each strain.
51	DDI-false	The following are examples of substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin: corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, albuterol, @DRUG$), isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives).
52	DDI-false	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, @DRUG$, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
53	DDI-false	Interactions may also occur with the following: anti-depressants/anti-anxiety drugs, drugs used to treat an overactive thyroid, @DRUG$ (e.g., propranolol), sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, guanethidine, guanadrel, metrizamide, cabergoline, lithium, narcotic pain medication (e.g., codeine), drugs used to aid sleep, drowsiness-causing @DRUG$ (e.g., diphenhydramine), any other drugs that may make you drowsy.
54	DDI-false	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
55	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
56	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
57	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
58	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
59	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
60	DDI-mechanism	Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 47% decrease in ethinyl estradiol and an 18% decrease in norethindrone plasma concentrations.
61	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
62	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents.
63	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
64	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
65	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
66	DDI-mechanism	Ephedrine: @DRUG$ may enhance the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
67	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
68	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
69	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
70	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
71	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
72	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
73	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: @DRUG$, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide.
74	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or @DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
75	DDI-effect	There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of @DRUG$ that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
76	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
77	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
78	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
79	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
80	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
81	DDI-effect	Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by @DRUG$ and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of @DRUG$.
82	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
83	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and @DRUG$, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
84	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
85	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
86	DDI-effect	Haloperidol: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$.
87	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
88	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
89	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
90	DDI-mechanism	This antagonistic effect of @DRUG$ on @DRUG$ natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide.
91	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
92	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
93	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
94	DDI-mechanism	In vitro data suggest that @DRUG$, when compared to ketoconazole, has a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
95	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
96	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
97	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
98	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
99	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
100	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
101	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, @DRUG$, and sertraline.
102	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
103	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
104	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
105	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
106	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
107	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
108	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$;"
109	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
110	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
111	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ have been reported to competitively inhibit @DRUG$ accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.
112	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
113	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
114	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
115	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any @DRUG$, including Solganal and Myochrysine.
116	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.

118	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
119	DDI-mechanism	However, in the second study, administration of 12 g @DRUG$ 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg @DRUG$ approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the cerivastatin AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
120	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
121	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
122	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
123	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
124	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
125	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (@DRUG$, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
126	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ are reported to fluctuate significantly when @DRUG$ is either added or deleted from the drug regimen.
127	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other @DRUG$ that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin.
128	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.

136	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
137	DDI-effect	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
138	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the plasma levels of @DRUG$, if given concomitantly.
139	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
140	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
141	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an 82% decrease in nelfinavir plasma A.C.

157	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with @DRUG$.
158	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
159	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of @DRUG$.
160	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
161	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: @DRUG$, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
162	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
163	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
164	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
165	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
