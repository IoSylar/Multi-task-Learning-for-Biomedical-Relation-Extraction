0	DDI-false	@DRUG$s: Thyroxine increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
1	DDI-false	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received @DRUG$ within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with opioid analgesics
2	DDI-false	Interactions may also occur with the following: anti-depressants/anti-anxiety drugs, drugs used to treat an overactive thyroid, @DRUG$ (e.g., propranolol), sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, guanethidine, guanadrel, @DRUG$, cabergoline, lithium, narcotic pain medication (e.g., codeine), drugs used to aid sleep, drowsiness-causing antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine), any other drugs that may make you drowsy.
3	DDI-false	@DRUG$: In a prospective study involving six-healthy-male volunteers, @DRUG$ did not affect the metabolism of terfenadine.
4	DDI-false	Bentiromide may interact with @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
5	DDI-false	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), @DRUG$ (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
6	DDI-false	Effect of @DRUG$ on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$.
7	DDI-false	@DRUG$: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN.
8	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
9	DDI-false	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with saquinavir;"
10	DDI-false	Additionally, @DRUG$, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine.
11	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
12	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, @DRUG$, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
13	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
14	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
15	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, @DRUG$ and phenobarbital, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
16	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with diuretics, @DRUG$, or other vasodilators.
17	DDI-mechanism	"Although no studies have been conducted, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of phenytoin;"
18	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
19	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
20	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
21	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
22	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, @DRUG$, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
23	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
24	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
25	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
26	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
27	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
28	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
29	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
30	DDI-effect	Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
31	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
32	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including @DRUG$, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
33	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
34	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, @DRUG$, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
35	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
36	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
37	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
38	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
39	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
40	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
41	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
42	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
43	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
44	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with succinylcholine or with other @DRUG$.
