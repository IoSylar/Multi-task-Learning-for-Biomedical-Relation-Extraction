0	DDI-false	@DRUG$s: Thyroxine increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
1	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
4	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
