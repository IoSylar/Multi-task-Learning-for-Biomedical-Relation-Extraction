0	CPRFalse	Loperamide, an opiate analog, differently modifies the adrenocorticotropin responses to @CHEMICAL$ and @GENE$ in patients with Addison's disease.
1	CPR:4	"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (""@CHEMICAL$"") inhibits HER2-driven signaling and suppresses the growth of @GENE$-overexpressing tumor cells."
2	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ exhibited a significantly higher Vmax and Km values toward both @GENE$ and UDP-glucuronic acid than the other UGTs. 5.  Human, pig and rabbit, but not rat liver microsomes, catalyzed HFC glucuronidation at high rates. 6.  This new method is particularly suitable for fast activity screenings of UGTs 1A6, 1A7, 1A10 and 2A1 and HFC glucuronidation activity determination from various samples.
3	CPR:6	Doses of dimethocaine (1.7 mg/kg) and cocaine (0.3 mg/kg) which produced full (> 80%) substitution for cocaine were administered in combination with the @CHEMICAL$ antagonist SCH 39166 (@GENE$) and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride (both at 0.003-0.03 mg/kg).
4	CPR:3	Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported @CHEMICAL$ target genes in response to NRF2 inducers (sulforaphane, @GENE$, cinnamic aldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide) showed that the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C1 is highly inducible by all treatments.
5	CPR:5	The involvement of @CHEMICAL$ and EP2 receptors is indicated by studies with the EP1 selective agonist @GENE$, and the EP2 selective agonist butaprost (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists SC-51089 (EP1 specific) and AH 6809 (EP1 and EP2 specific).
