123	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
124	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, @DRUG$, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
125	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
126	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
127	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
128	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.

141	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
142	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either amiodarone or @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
143	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
144	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.

148	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
149	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: A study in 6 healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a 1 week course of @DRUG$ at 1000 mg per day and @DRUG$ at 40 mg per day.
150	DDI-effect	Aminoglycosides: The mixing of @DRUG$ with an @DRUG$ in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.
151	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, @DRUG$ salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
152	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

154	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
155	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
156	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
157	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral @DRUG$.
158	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
159	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
160	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
161	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
162	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
163	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
164	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
165	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the dosage of warfarin should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time.
166	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
167	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
168	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
169	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.

171	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with succinylcholine or with other @DRUG$.
172	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
173	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
174	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, @DRUG$, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone

176	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
177	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
178	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and @DRUG$) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
179	DDI-effect	Phenobarbital toxicity has been reported to have occurred in a patient on chronic @DRUG$ treatment following the initiation of @DRUG$ therapy.
180	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, @DRUG$, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
181	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
182	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
183	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
184	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
185	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
186	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
187	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
188	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
189	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
190	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
191	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other @DRUG$, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
192	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
193	DDI-effect	Synergism has been shown between @DRUG$ anesthesia and intravenously administered @DRUG$.
194	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
195	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
196	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
197	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
198	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
199	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and @DRUG$, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
200	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
201	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
202	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
203	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
204	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace @DRUG$s, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.
205	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
206	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
207	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
208	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
209	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, @DRUG$, vitamin D.
210	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
211	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
212	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
213	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
214	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;"
215	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ decreased the maximum plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.
216	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
217	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
218	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
219	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
220	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
221	DDI-mechanism	Ibuprofen - @DRUG$ may increase the absorption of @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
222	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
223	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of @DRUG$ (or rifabutin) and @DRUG$.
224	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
225	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with midazolam or @DRUG$ has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
226	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, @DRUG$, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
227	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral @DRUG$, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
228	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
229	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
230	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, @DRUG$, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
231	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
232	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
233	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
234	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
235	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
236	DDI-mechanism	This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.
237	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, @DRUG$ resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
238	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
239	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
240	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and @DRUG$.
241	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
242	DDI-mechanism	In patients given very high doses (3900 mg) of @DRUG$ daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when @DRUG$, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.
243	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
244	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
245	DDI-effect	Norepinephrine: @DRUG$ enhance the adrenergic effect of @DRUG$.
246	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
247	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
248	DDI-mechanism	Inducers and Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism: @DRUG$ reduced plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ by about 70%.
249	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
250	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other @DRUG$ such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
251	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and @DRUG$.
252	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
253	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
254	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain @DRUG$, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
255	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
256	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of rifampicin (or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
257	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of carbachol or @DRUG$;"
258	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: @DRUG$, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
259	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effects of captopril and @DRUG$.
260	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, @DRUG$ or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
261	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and @DRUG$ by approximately 30% and 20%.
262	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
263	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin @DRUG$ midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
264	DDI-advise	Since @DRUG$ are potentiated by the @DRUG$, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions.
265	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as @DRUG$, barbiturates, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
266	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
267	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
268	DDI-effect	In patients receiving @DRUG$, the addition of @DRUG$ to therapy could prolong the prothrombin time.

270	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
271	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ has been reported.
272	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: @DRUG$, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
273	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
274	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
275	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
276	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
277	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer @DRUG$ did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.
278	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
279	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
280	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
281	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, @DRUG$, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
282	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or @DRUG$-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
283	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), @DRUG$ containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
284	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, @DRUG$ and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
285	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that @DRUG$, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN.
286	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

289	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
290	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.
291	DDI-mechanism	Ibuprofen - @DRUG$ may increase the absorption of @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
292	DDI-effect	Studies in rats have shown that @DRUG$ administration attenuates certain types of adrenocortical steroid dependent hypertension, including @DRUG$ hypertension.
293	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
294	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, @DRUG$ and itraconazole) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
295	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: @DRUG$, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
296	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
297	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
298	DDI-effect	Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when @DRUG$ infection and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly.
299	DDI-mechanism	Oral doses of @DRUG$ (10-20 mg/kg), via alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition, significantly reduced the rate of elimination of @DRUG$ (by approximately 40%) given to healthy volunteers in moderate doses.
300	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, @DRUG$, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone

302	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants: There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ were used concomitantly.
303	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
304	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
305	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
306	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
307	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
308	DDI-effect	Aminoglutethimide: @DRUG$ may diminish adrenal suppression by @DRUG$.
309	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$.
310	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to insulin or oral @DRUG$.
311	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
312	DDI-effect	The onset of neuromuscular blockade by @DRUG$ was unaffected by @DRUG$, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
313	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
314	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
315	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
316	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
317	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
318	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
319	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
320	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
321	DDI-advise	Carbamazepine: Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels @DRUG$ levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with @DRUG$, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
322	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
323	DDI-mechanism	The oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ is reduced by 60% with coadministration of @DRUG$.
324	DDI-advise	A 5-mg @DRUG$ dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily @DRUG$.
325	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
326	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
327	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
328	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
329	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
330	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
331	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and @DRUG$, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
332	DDI-mechanism	In addition, higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking @DRUG$.
333	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and @DRUG$ can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
334	DDI-effect	In addition, @DRUG$ alone can inhibit adrenal @DRUG$ synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.
335	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
336	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, @DRUG$, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

338	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
339	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
340	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
341	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
342	DDI-effect	In combination with other @DRUG$, @DRUG$ may still kill even experienced users, particularly if their tolerance to the drug has reduced or the strength of their usual dose has increased.
343	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
344	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and tricyclic anti-depressants could exaggerate the prolongation of the QT interval observed with @DRUG$.
345	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
346	DDI-effect	As the primary effect of @DRUG$ is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of @DRUG$.
347	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
348	DDI-mechanism	Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy @DRUG$ intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
349	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
350	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
351	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
352	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
353	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
354	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: rifabutin
355	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.

361	DDI-mechanism	During administration of multiple oral doses of @DRUG$ to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of @DRUG$, a 13%-19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.
362	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
363	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
364	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., @DRUG$).
365	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
