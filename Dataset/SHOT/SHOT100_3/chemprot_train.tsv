In the absence of cTnI, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of @GENE$-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.

70	CPRFalse	The L0 linker has been reported to be required for glibenclamide binding, and DeltaNK(IR)6.2/@CHEMICAL$ channels exhibit reduced labeling of K(IR) with @GENE$, implying that the K(IR) N terminus and L0 of SUR1 are in proximity.

Lisuride produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-HT(1A) receptors.
591	CPR:5	Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine @CHEMICAL$ agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including leflunomide, flutamide, and @GENE$.
592	CPR:5	Methanandamide (10.0 mg/kg) had lesser effect than other CB agonists, and the @CHEMICAL$ agonist AM1241 [@GENE$], the anandamide transport inhibitor AM404, and the CB antagonist rimonabant did not have diuretic effects.
593	CPR:5	The selective @CHEMICAL$ antagonists atenolol and metoprolol blocked @GENE$-induced enhancement, with apparent K(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively.
594	CPR:5	@CHEMICAL$ was previously identified in mammalian brain and was shown to be a co-agonist at the 'glycine' site of the @GENE$.
595	CPR:5	One of the @CHEMICAL$ agonists, @GENE$ (19, -logEC(50)=7.5, E(max)=255%) was selected for further development.
596	CPR:5	Pharmacology of @CHEMICAL$, a selective @GENE$/MT2 receptor agonist: a novel therapeutic drug for sleep disorders.
597	CPR:5	In contrast, the @CHEMICAL$-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed @GENE$ and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM).
598	CPR:5	The involvement of EP1 and EP2 receptors is indicated by studies with the EP1 selective agonist 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, and the @CHEMICAL$ selective agonist butaprost (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists SC-51089 (EP1 specific) and @GENE$ (EP1 and EP2 specific).
599	CPR:5	The beta(2)-adrenoceptor (@CHEMICAL$) agonists clenbuterol and @GENE$ have similar beneficial effects in animal models of heart failure.
