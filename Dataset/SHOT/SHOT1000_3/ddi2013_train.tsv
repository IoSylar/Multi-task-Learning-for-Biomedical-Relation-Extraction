972	DDI-false	therefore, it is theoretically possible that lansoprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
973	DDI-false	The @DRUG$ metabolite of @DRUG$ does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
974	DDI-false	Since higher doses of @DRUG$ (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of Vardenafil should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$ 400 mg daily.
975	DDI-false	therefore, it is theoretically possible that lansoprazole may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
976	DDI-false	Antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of @DRUG$ or @DRUG$.

981	DDI-false	@DRUG$: while a synergistic relationship with @DRUG$ has been reported, concomitant use may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion.
982	DDI-false	"Both the toxicity of @DRUG$ and the therapeutic value of @DRUG$ can be rationalized at the cellular and molecular level by the following observations: (i) these polyene antibiotics showed differential effects on cells;"
983	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
984	DDI-false	The IV @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with Aprepitant to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
985	DDI-false	Therefore, co-administration of Duloxetine with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.

1203	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
1204	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
1205	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
1206	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1207	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
1208	DDI-effect	Aminoglutethimide: @DRUG$ may diminish adrenal suppression by @DRUG$.

1210	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to insulin or oral @DRUG$.
1211	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
1212	DDI-effect	The onset of neuromuscular blockade by @DRUG$ was unaffected by @DRUG$, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
1213	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
1214	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).

1217	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
1218	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
1219	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
1220	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
1221	DDI-advise	Carbamazepine: Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels @DRUG$ levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with @DRUG$, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
1222	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both T4 and @DRUG$ in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
1223	DDI-mechanism	The oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ is reduced by 60% with coadministration of @DRUG$.
1224	DDI-advise	A 5-mg @DRUG$ dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily @DRUG$.
1225	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1226	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1227	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.

1229	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
1230	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1231	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and @DRUG$, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1232	DDI-mechanism	In addition, higher-than expected steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ have been observed when therapy is initiated in patients already taking @DRUG$.
1233	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and @DRUG$ can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
1234	DDI-effect	In addition, @DRUG$ alone can inhibit adrenal @DRUG$ synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.
1235	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
1236	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, @DRUG$, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1237	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), @DRUG$ (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1238	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
1239	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
1240	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
1241	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
1242	DDI-effect	In combination with other @DRUG$, @DRUG$ may still kill even experienced users, particularly if their tolerance to the drug has reduced or the strength of their usual dose has increased.
1243	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1244	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and tricyclic anti-depressants could exaggerate the prolongation of the QT interval observed with @DRUG$.
1245	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
1246	DDI-effect	As the primary effect of @DRUG$ is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of @DRUG$.
1247	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
1248	DDI-mechanism	Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy @DRUG$ intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
1249	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
1250	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
1251	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
1252	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1253	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
1254	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: rifabutin
1255	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
1256	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like @DRUG$ or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
1257	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
1258	DDI-advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg @DRUG$ dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1259	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
1260	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, methotrexate, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
1261	DDI-mechanism	During administration of multiple oral doses of @DRUG$ to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of @DRUG$, a 13%-19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.
1262	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.
1263	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
1264	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., @DRUG$).
1265	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1266	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1267	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
1268	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1269	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 isozymes responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
1270	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
1271	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1272	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1273	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1274	DDI-effect	apomorphine - prior ingestion of @DRUG$ may decrease the emetic response to @DRUG$ in the treatment of poisoning.
1275	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem and @DRUG$ with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
1276	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, @DRUG$, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1277	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
1278	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant use of some @DRUG$.
1279	DDI-mechanism	Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin): Steady state plasma exposure (AUC) of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 12 days) was decreased by 27% when co-administered with multiple doses (300 mg QD for 12 days) of @DRUG$ (a CYP 3A4 inducer).
1280	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1281	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
1282	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
1283	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
1284	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1285	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
1286	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
1287	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants, causing increased sedative effects.
1288	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
1289	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, @DRUG$, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
1290	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing @DRUG$, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1291	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
1292	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1293	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (Ultram).
1294	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1295	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
1296	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1297	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
1298	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
1299	DDI-mechanism	Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$.
1300	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
1301	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
1302	DDI-effect	An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS) followed by irreversible brain damage has occurred in a few patients treated with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
1303	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), @DRUG$ (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1304	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1305	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1306	DDI-effect	Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
1307	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
1308	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
1309	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
1310	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
1311	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1312	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1313	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
1314	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1315	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
1316	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1317	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and @DRUG$ resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
1318	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1319	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
1320	DDI-effect	It is not known whether this potentiation of @DRUG$ rashes is due to @DRUG$ or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
1321	DDI-effect	The potential for increased sedation when @DRUG$ is given with other @DRUG$ should be appreciated.
1322	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
1323	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
1324	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, @DRUG$, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1325	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1326	DDI-advise	Thus patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.
1327	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1328	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
1329	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
1330	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous @DRUG$ (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
1331	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
1332	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
1333	DDI-advise	Consequently, the combination of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is also contraindicated.
1334	DDI-mechanism	Withdrawal of @DRUG$ decreased the @DRUG$ requirement by 50%.
1335	DDI-mechanism	"A number of drugs, including @DRUG$, have been shown to displace @DRUG$ from plasma protein;"
1336	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
1337	DDI-mechanism	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The administration of @DRUG$ to normal volunteers receiving @DRUG$ decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
1338	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1339	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients who are receiving sympathomimetic or @DRUG$ may result in an additive pressor effect .
1340	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of heparin or @DRUG$.
1341	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and @DRUG$, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1342	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1343	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and @DRUG$, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1344	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
1345	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
1346	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
1347	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
1348	DDI-effect	In both species, @DRUG$, but not (+)-NANM, antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of @DRUG$ on FI and FR responding.
1349	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1350	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
1351	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other @DRUG$, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
1352	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, @DRUG$, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1353	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
1354	DDI-effect	We conclude that @DRUG$ prevents @DRUG$-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
1355	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
1356	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
1357	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and @DRUG$.
1358	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1359	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine - @DRUG$ may counteract the antinaturetic effect of @DRUG$.
1360	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ Injection and @DRUG$ in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.
1361	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
1362	DDI-effect	Adrenergic Agents:Some individuals receiving @DRUG$ may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressor or @DRUG$.
1363	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or @DRUG$, and iron-containing preparations.
1364	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
1365	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
1366	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
1367	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
1368	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ diminishes the effect of @DRUG$ and warfarin.
1369	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1370	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
1371	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
1372	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
1373	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
1374	DDI-effect	Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a @DRUG$.
1375	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ including INDOCIN has been reported.
1376	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (@DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
1377	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
1378	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
1379	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other @DRUG$ while taking digoxin, @DRUG$, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
1380	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;@DRUG$;and quinidine."
1381	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
1382	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
1383	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including @DRUG$ and Myochrysine.
1384	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1385	DDI-effect	In an emergency situation when opioid analgesia must be administered to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the amount of @DRUG$ required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged.
1386	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1387	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.

1393	DDI-effect	Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were used in combination.
1394	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
1395	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose @DRUG$ coadministration leads to higher @DRUG$ exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus.
1396	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
1397	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose.

1437	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ effects are potentiated by @DRUG$.
1438	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
1439	DDI-advise	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1440	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.

1473	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple dose study of @DRUG$ (400 mg once daily for 3 days) and @DRUG$ (20 mg once daily for 3 days), a 16% decrease in the clearance of cetirizine was observed.
1474	DDI-effect	In post-marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1475	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
1476	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
1477	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with midazolam or @DRUG$ has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.

1479	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
1480	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents.
1481	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1482	DDI-mechanism	Phenylbutazone: @DRUG$ causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of @DRUG$.
1483	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.

1521	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline .
1522	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
1523	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as @DRUG$) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
1524	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedating drugs.

1530	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
1531	DDI-advise	Barbiturates and @DRUG$ should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
1532	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate @DRUG$ Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
1533	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1534	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$ careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.

1537	DDI-effect	Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including @DRUG$.
1538	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including @DRUG$, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1539	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1540	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, @DRUG$, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1541	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ or calcium channel blockers and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
1542	DDI-effect	When taken orally , @DRUG$ like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
1543	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ inhibited the @DRUG$-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase due to release from the Ca(2+) store.
1544	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or @DRUG$ in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
1545	DDI-effect	Antidiabetics: Because @DRUG$ may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of @DRUG$ may be required.
1546	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

1563	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
1564	DDI-effect	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis.
1565	DDI-advise	Thus, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
1566	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1567	DDI-advise	@DRUG$: generally should not be given with @DRUG$.
1568	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
1569	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, @DRUG$, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
1570	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ was applied to the muscle in the presence of @DRUG$, both first and second contractile responses to PTX were abolished.
1571	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, @DRUG$) should be considered.
1572	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.

1579	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
1580	DDI-advise	Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral @DRUG$, should be used cautiously in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1581	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, @DRUG$, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1582	DDI-effect	The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when @DRUG$ was administered on the same day as @DRUG$ than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients).
1583	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating @DRUG$ such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.
1584	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.

1594	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1595	DDI-effect	Flucytosine: while a synergistic relationship with @DRUG$ has been reported, concomitant use may increase the toxicity of @DRUG$ by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion.
1596	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
1597	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, @DRUG$, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.

1606	DDI-effect	Antihistamines: @DRUG$ may counteract the sedative effect of @DRUG$.
1607	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving @DRUG$ or amoxicillin concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
1608	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, @DRUG$, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
1609	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, @DRUG$, metoclopramide, pimozide.
1610	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
1611	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
1612	DDI-advise	Patients who are applying @DRUG$ gel should not concurrently use products that contain @DRUG$ (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products.
1613	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ during therapy with a @DRUG$ has been shown to produce a  stimulating  effect in some depressed patients.
1614	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$ analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
1615	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.
1616	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
1617	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids, Methylxanthines and Diuretics: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate a possible hypokalemic effect of  @DRUG$
1618	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1619	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1620	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and enalapril IV is augmented by @DRUG$ that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).
1621	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
1622	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
1623	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
1624	DDI-advise	Because a similar interaction is likely, @DRUG$ should also not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
1625	DDI-effect	Particular caution is necessary when using @DRUG$ in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (especially @DRUG$) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effect by flumazenil.
1626	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase slightly the effect of antihypertensive drugs, e.g., guanethidine, @DRUG$, reserpine.
1627	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary.
1628	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
1629	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$.
1630	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1631	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1632	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ and ergotamine or @DRUG$ has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
1633	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, @DRUG$, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
1634	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1635	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
1636	DDI-effect	Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of @DRUG$ and 75 - 150 mg of @DRUG$.
1637	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
1638	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
1639	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1640	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1641	DDI-effect	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin.
1642	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), @DRUG$ and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1643	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including @DRUG$ or its derivatives or similar agents.
1644	DDI-advise	Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of @DRUG$ are to be administered with @DRUG$ because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
1645	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
1646	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as @DRUG$, spironolactone, and cimetidine.
1647	DDI-effect	Interaction on the antinociceptive effect between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or tuftsin.
1648	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
1649	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a @DRUG$ and a calcium channel blocker.
1650	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
1651	DDI-effect	Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., @DRUG$), ephedrine, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
1652	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1653	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
1654	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
1655	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
1656	DDI-effect	Infusion requirements of NIMBEX in patients administered @DRUG$ prior to infusions of @DRUG$ were comparable to or slightly greater than when succinylcholine was not administered.
1657	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1658	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of @DRUG$.
1659	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1660	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1661	DDI-advise	Diazepam: The co-administration of @DRUG$ Tablets and @DRUG$ is generally not advisable.
1662	DDI-effect	The addition of 540 mg/kg/day of @DRUG$ (approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) to 2.7 mg/kg/day of @DRUG$ (approximately 7 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) appears to have increased the incidence of both resorptions and malformations.
1663	DDI-effect	Ketamine: Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported in association with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1664	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (@DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1665	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, @DRUG$, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
1666	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
1667	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
1668	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
1669	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
1670	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: Quinolones, including @DRUG$, decrease the clearance of @DRUG$, the less active isomer of racemic warfarin.
1671	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1672	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
1673	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
1674	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
1675	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes @DRUG$, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
1676	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
1677	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1678	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
1679	DDI-effect	Cyclopropane or @DRUG$ increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as @DRUG$.
1680	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
1681	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
1682	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives @DRUG$: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1683	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, @DRUG$, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
1684	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
1685	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1686	DDI-effect	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by @DRUG$ overdose with a positive @DRUG$ level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of carbamazepine with a toxicology screen for tricyclic antidepressants.
1687	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1688	DDI-effect	Anticholinergic agents: Although @DRUG$ is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used @DRUG$.
1689	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of @DRUG$ and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
1690	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
1691	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
1692	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer @DRUG$ did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.
1693	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1694	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
1695	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
1696	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational anesthetics such as @DRUG$ are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
1697	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
1698	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
1699	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1700	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1701	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$ and losartan.
1702	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
1703	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1704	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1705	DDI-mechanism	Metformin: In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, plasma metformin mean cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%.
1706	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1707	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
1708	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered with warfarin or its derivatives.
1709	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and quinidine.
1710	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1711	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decreased the hyperuricemic effect of @DRUG$.
1712	DDI-mechanism	In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between @DRUG$ (a benzodiazepine) and @DRUG$ under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product.
1713	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
1714	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
1715	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1716	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
1717	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1718	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, @DRUG$, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
1719	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with acetaminophen overdosage or in those taking @DRUG$.
1720	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
1721	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as @DRUG$ or tolbutamide from their binding sites.
1722	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
1723	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1724	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with @DRUG$ (Depen, Cuprimine), another arthritis medication.
1725	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1726	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
1727	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
1728	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
1729	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, @DRUG$, and some macrolide antibiotics.
1730	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (@DRUG$, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
1731	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, @DRUG$, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1732	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1733	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1734	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and @DRUG$.
1735	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1736	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
1737	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of ascorbic acid (@DRUG$) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
1738	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1739	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
1740	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, etc).
1741	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either @DRUG$ or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
1742	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$  causes a decrease in the steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration.

1744	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
1745	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or @DRUG$, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
1746	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), @DRUG$ (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).

1867	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1868	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
1869	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
1870	DDI-effect	In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of @DRUG$-related toxicity when given supplemental @DRUG$ at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day.
1871	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or @DRUG$, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1872	DDI-advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for @DRUG$ (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with @DRUG$ coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
1873	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for norethindrone and @DRUG$.
1874	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
1875	DDI-effect	Clinically significant effects have been reported with the @DRUG$ when used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1876	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, @DRUG$, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1877	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
1878	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1879	DDI-effect	In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg daily of @DRUG$ with the ACE inhibitor @DRUG$, 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks, was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to ACE inhibitor alone.
1880	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
1881	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other @DRUG$ have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
1882	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with 40 mg @DRUG$ tablets in epileptic patients lowered the nisoldipine plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
1883	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of H1 and @DRUG$.
1884	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1885	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
1886	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
1887	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1888	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients under @DRUG$ therapy should be carefully monitored when concomitant @DRUG$ therapy is indicated.
1889	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1890	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
1891	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
1892	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on the @DRUG$ requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of rifampin and extended a similar length of time after rifampin withdrawal.
1893	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased 62% when coadministered with @DRUG$ and 38% when coadministered with ketoconazole.
1894	DDI-effect	Synergism was observed when @DRUG$ was combined with @DRUG$ against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella oxytoca.
1895	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
1896	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1897	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
1898	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
1899	DDI-effect	Phenytoin: Serum @DRUG$ levels may be increased by @DRUG$.
1900	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING @DRUG$ AND ITS CONGENERS.
1901	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in an eight-fold increase in the mean AUC of cisapride.
1902	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ increases the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in a shortened elimination half-life of ZEBETA.
1903	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
1904	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse (@DRUG$, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
1905	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1906	DDI-mechanism	Repeated doses of @DRUG$ given prior to a single dose of @DRUG$ in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption.
1907	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
1908	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
1909	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate @DRUG$- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
1910	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
1911	DDI-advise	Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between TORADOL and warfarin or heparin, the administration of @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$ should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored.
1912	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, @DRUG$) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1913	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
1914	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1915	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1916	DDI-advise	The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotensin can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
1917	DDI-advise	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
1918	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$).
1919	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
1920	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with @DRUG$ and/or cisplatin.1
1921	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
1922	DDI-effect	Hypotension   Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of @DRUG$.
1923	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
1924	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, @DRUG$, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1925	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
1926	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or @DRUG$, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
1927	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1928	DDI-advise	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by carbamazepine overdose with a positive tricyclic antidepressant level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of @DRUG$ with a toxicology screen for @DRUG$.
1929	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1930	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving @DRUG$ and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
1931	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
1932	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
1933	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1934	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
1935	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
1936	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1937	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
1938	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
1939	DDI-effect	Since @DRUG$ inhibits platelet function, there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients maintained on @DRUG$.
1940	DDI-effect	Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the @DRUG$ of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of @DRUG$, it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly.
1941	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
1942	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is used with @DRUG$ in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur.
1943	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells, but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of @DRUG$ when both are added simultaneously.
1944	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1945	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
1946	DDI-advise	Lithium serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1947	DDI-advise	These results would seem to dictate against the clinical use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, or during the period following ELSPAR therapy when plasma asparagine levels are below normal.
1948	DDI-effect	ERGAMISOL  (@DRUG$) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1949	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
1950	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
1951	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1952	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ including INDOCIN has been reported.
1953	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including @DRUG$ and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
1954	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, caffeine, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
1955	DDI-effect	The response to @DRUG$ may be blunted by phenothiazines and @DRUG$ which cause a rise in prolactin.
1956	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, @DRUG$, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1957	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1958	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, @DRUG$, lovastatin, simvastatin).
1959	DDI-effect	Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship, physicians should be aware that variable effects an blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1960	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
1961	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
1962	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol.
1963	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
1964	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1965	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., @DRUG$), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1966	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
1967	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that ketoconazole or @DRUG$ co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
1968	DDI-advise	Patients already stabilized on @DRUG$ should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with @DRUG$ coadministration.
1969	DDI-effect	Taking @DRUG$ after drinking @DRUG$ may worsen side effects and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.
1970	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.

1974	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other @DRUG$, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1975	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, @DRUG$, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1976	DDI-effect	There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1977	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and @DRUG$.
1978	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.

1986	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral @DRUG$ increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.
1987	DDI-mechanism	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$.
1988	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.

2128	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
2129	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2130	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2131	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
2132	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs.
2133	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
2134	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2135	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and @DRUG$ may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
2136	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that ketoconazole or @DRUG$ co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
2137	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ increases both free and bound @DRUG$ by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
2138	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2139	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using @DRUG$ or digitalis concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2140	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 152% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and very little change in ritonavir plasma A.C.
2141	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of @DRUG$ and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
2142	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, @DRUG$, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2143	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2144	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2145	DDI-effect	Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently.
2146	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2147	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or @DRUG$ in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
2148	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and @DRUG$, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
2149	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
2150	DDI-effect	In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$

2152	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$-containing minipill preparations.
2153	DDI-advise	Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2154	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with @DRUG$ (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2155	DDI-effect	It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed.
2156	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
2157	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
2158	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), @DRUG$.

2164	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$s serum concentrations.
2165	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2166	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduces the clearance of @DRUG$.
2167	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
2168	DDI-mechanism	Another oral azole antifungal, @DRUG$, inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastermizole which may prolong QT intervals.

2174	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2175	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2177	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2178	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
2179	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2180	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of anakinra (an @DRUG$) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2181	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2182	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
2183	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2184	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when @DRUG$ and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
2185	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing @DRUG$, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2186	DDI-advise	All @DRUG$ should be used cautiously in patients taking @DRUG$.
2187	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), @DRUG$ (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2188	DDI-effect	Adrenergic Agents:Some individuals receiving @DRUG$ may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressor or @DRUG$.
2189	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised during the administration of @DRUG$ to patients anaesthetised with @DRUG$ as arrhythmias may be precipitated.
2190	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
2191	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2192	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
2193	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
2194	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, @DRUG$, tolbutamide, trazodone
2195	DDI-effect	Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents: Experience in over 1400 patients in a non-comparative clinical trial has shown that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is usually well tolerated, but there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina.
2196	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), @DRUG$ (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"

2198	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with etanercept alone (0%).
2199	DDI-mechanism	Clofibric acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
2200	DDI-mechanism	ERYTHROMYCIN: In hypercholesterolemic patients, steady-state @DRUG$ AUC and Cmax increased approximately 50% and 24% respectively after 10 days with co-administration of @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
2201	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
2202	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
2203	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
2204	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
2205	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
2206	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating @DRUG$ such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.
2207	DDI-effect	When other antiplatelet agents or @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
2208	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
2209	DDI-effect	aBased on reports of narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, and evidence of decreased plasma concentrations of methadone.
2210	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
2211	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2212	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
2213	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered until a patient has recovered from @DRUG$-induced neuromuscular block.
2214	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2215	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2216	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
2217	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
2218	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
2219	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2220	DDI-effect	Taking a @DRUG$ while you are taking or within 2 weeks of taking @DRUG$ may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction.
2221	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, @DRUG$, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2222	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2223	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
2224	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a @DRUG$ (SSRI) and @DRUG$.
2225	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2226	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
2227	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
2228	DDI-mechanism	The absorption of oral @DRUG$ is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an antacid containing @DRUG$ and magnesium.
2229	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$.
2230	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
2231	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2232	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2233	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2234	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing @DRUG$ (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2235	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
2236	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
2237	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or @DRUG$/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
2238	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2239	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2240	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant use of some @DRUG$.
2241	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as @DRUG$.
2242	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
2243	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2244	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2245	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.
2246	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2247	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
2248	DDI-mechanism	Conversely, the @DRUG$ have been reported to increase the serum levels and prolong the serum half-life of @DRUG$ by inhibiting its metabolism.
2249	DDI-effect	Particular caution should be observed with @DRUG$ since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin.
2250	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ use in patients who are receiving high doses of @DRUG$ may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity.
2251	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
2252	DDI-advise	In patients receiving @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ concomitantly, any reduction in steroid dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden steroid withdrawal.
2253	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
2254	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general @DRUG$.
2255	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, phenytoin, or @DRUG$ increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
2256	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$ chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2257	DDI-effect	Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
2258	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ containing magnesium or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2259	DDI-effect	In single and multiple dose studies in healthy subjects receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, prothrombin time (measured as INR) was increased by approximately 8% to 11%.
2260	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients taking @DRUG$, because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
2261	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, @DRUG$, or thiazolesulfone.
2262	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
2263	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2264	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, @DRUG$ and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2265	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2266	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2267	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2268	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the adverse effects of other @DRUG$ administered concomitantly.
2269	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2270	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
2271	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
2272	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
2273	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2274	DDI-effect	The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.
2275	DDI-mechanism	In vitro, @DRUG$ may displace less firmly bound drugs like @DRUG$.
2276	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a @DRUG$ and a calcium channel blocker.
2277	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or @DRUG$ (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2278	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2279	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ in patients who are receiving @DRUG$ may potentiate renal disease states.
2280	DDI-advise	Although this interaction has not been reported with cinoxacin, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ is given concomitantly with @DRUG$-containing products.
2281	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2282	DDI-effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated.
2283	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or @DRUG$.
2284	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
2285	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
2286	DDI-effect	Both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ slow AV conduction.
2287	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2288	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
2289	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, @DRUG$ (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
2290	DDI-mechanism	Antacid (Maalox ): @DRUG$ reduced the bioavailability of @DRUG$ (N=16) by about 20%.
2291	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as @DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
2292	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other @DRUG$ that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin.
2293	DDI-effect	As with some other @DRUG$, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by NUROMAX is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
2294	DDI-effect	Prior administration of @DRUG$ (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of @DRUG$ (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
2295	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2296	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/@DRUG$, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
2297	DDI-advise	SUBUTEX and @DRUG$ should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
2298	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised during the administration of @DRUG$ to patients anaesthetised with @DRUG$ as arrhythmias may be precipitated.
2299	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2300	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, @DRUG$, alcohol or codeine.
2301	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25% when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered.
2302	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2303	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
2304	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2305	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
2306	DDI-effect	ETHANOL / NUTRITION / HERB INTERACTIONS: Food: CNS effects of caffeine may be enhanced if @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
2307	DDI-effect	Iodine or iodine excess may decrease the effect of Carbimazole, and an @DRUG$ deficiency can increase the effect of @DRUG$.
2308	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2309	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (@DRUG$, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2310	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2311	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain @DRUG$, etc.).
2312	DDI-effect	ACE-inhibitors:Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
2313	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, @DRUG$ and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
2314	DDI-effect	In patients who have received muscle relaxants, @DRUG$ may temporarily mask the residual effects of @DRUG$.
2315	DDI-effect	Hyperpyrexia has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
2316	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
2317	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2318	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
2319	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2320	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: May decrease renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
2321	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of @DRUG$ was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with @DRUG$ compared to when it was given alone.
2322	DDI-effect	The effects of concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on the PR interval were less than additive.
2323	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2325	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
2326	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2327	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ have been reported to competitively inhibit @DRUG$ accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.
2328	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
2329	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
2330	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2331	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
2332	DDI-effect	Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2333	DDI-effect	High-dose @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ protection.
2334	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
2335	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either @DRUG$ or minocycline.
2336	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
2337	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
2338	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

2340	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2341	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with diuretics (such as @DRUG$) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2342	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
2343	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.

2346	DDI-advise	Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of @DRUG$ while under treatment with @DRUG$ or SUBUTEX.
2347	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, @DRUG$, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2348	DDI-effect	It has been reported that @DRUG$ enhances the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
2349	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$) should be approached with caution.
2350	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
2351	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
2352	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2353	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2354	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2355	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2356	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
2357	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or @DRUG$) are additive.
2358	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
2359	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2360	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2361	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular @DRUG$ (50 microM) also inhibited @DRUG$-induced responses.
2362	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
2363	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2364	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
2365	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants and the muscle relaxant effects of @DRUG$.
2366	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2367	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
2368	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2369	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., @DRUG$), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2370	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of @DRUG$ in serum.
2371	DDI-advise	Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with @DRUG$ to extend the half-life of @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2372	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2373	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;"
2374	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.
2375	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
2376	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may have additive hypotensite effects due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism.
2377	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
2378	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
2379	DDI-effect	Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including @DRUG$.
2380	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Because @DRUG$ can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of @DRUG$ including TRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.
2381	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
2382	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (@DRUG$ and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
2383	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2384	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2385	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
2386	DDI-effect	Levodopa and Amantadine: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with either levodopa or @DRUG$.
2387	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2388	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
2389	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2390	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, @DRUG$, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2391	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), @DRUG$, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2392	DDI-effect	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ more commonly reported both weight gain and weight loss, compared with patients taking either medication alone.
2393	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
2394	DDI-effect	Two percent of patients treated concurrently with @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
2395	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
2396	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
2397	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and @DRUG$, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
2398	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
2399	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, @DRUG$, or its derivatives.
2400	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
2401	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
2402	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
2403	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with injectable @DRUG$, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2404	DDI-effect	Calcium Channel Blockers: Isolated cases of conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) have been observed when @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$.
2405	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and @DRUG$ (Ginkgo biloba).
2406	DDI-mechanism	However, @DRUG$ anesthetic requirement (i.e., MAC) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56% 1-2 hours and as much as 14% 5-6 hours after injection of @DRUG$, 50 mg/kg, im.
2407	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, @DRUG$ and mecamylamine.
2408	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2409	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
2410	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate @DRUG$ Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
2411	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
2412	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
2413	DDI-effect	Epidural @DRUG$ may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local @DRUG$, including both sensory and motor blockade.
2414	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
2415	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, procaine, or @DRUG$.
2416	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
2417	DDI-mechanism	Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 Cimetidine: @DRUG$ inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
2418	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
2419	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2420	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
2421	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$, phenobarbital, phenytoin).
2422	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2423	DDI-mechanism	Human growth hormone - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome.
2424	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking @DRUG$ (fluoxetine, thiothixene, alprazolam).
2425	DDI-effect	@DRUG$-induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by @DRUG$ or allopurinol.
2426	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
2427	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2428	DDI-mechanism	Chronic administration of @DRUG$, a known enzyme inducer, may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of @DRUG$.
2429	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
2430	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2431	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$ or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2432	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2433	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2434	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2435	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
2436	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
2437	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2438	DDI-effect	This allows @DRUG$ to open air passages, increasing the effectiveness of the @DRUG$.
2439	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and @DRUG$.
2440	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
2441	DDI-effect	The successive application of @DRUG$ (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
2442	DDI-mechanism	Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol) may be increased when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used in combination.
2443	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2444	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives.
2445	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2446	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2447	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
2448	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
2449	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
2450	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2451	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
2452	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2453	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
2454	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
2455	DDI-effect	Warfarin-@DRUG$ can antagonize the effect of @DRUG$
2456	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., @DRUG$) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
2457	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2458	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
2459	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
2460	DDI-mechanism	Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of @DRUG$ when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing @DRUG$.
2461	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
2462	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
2463	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
2464	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2465	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2466	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when @DRUG$ and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
2467	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, @DRUG$, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
2468	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
2469	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
2470	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
2471	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the neuron blockade produced by @DRUG$ resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter.
2472	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2473	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2474	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2475	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
2476	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2477	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2478	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including @DRUG$, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2479	DDI-advise	Experience with co-administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and Fentanyl in patients is limited,therefore,consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2480	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
2481	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, @DRUG$, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2482	DDI-mechanism	Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that omeprazole and @DRUG$ significantly increased the systemic exposure of @DRUG$ and/or its major metabolites.
2483	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (@DRUG$, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
2484	DDI-mechanism	Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.
2485	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2486	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
2487	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2488	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced @DRUG$ and iodamide excretion in chronic canine experiments.
2489	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Diclofenac and other @DRUG$ can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
2490	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2491	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2492	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
2493	DDI-effect	Although glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce PROLEUKIN-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other @DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotension seen with @DRUG$.
2494	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
2495	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, @DRUG$, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2496	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ are a major contributing factor to @DRUG$ toxicity.
2497	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2498	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2499	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or potent diuretics such as furosemide.
2500	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, @DRUG$, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2501	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2502	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2503	DDI-effect	CNS-Active Drugs Ethanol: @DRUG$ 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of @DRUG$ 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after ethanol administration.
2504	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
2505	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2506	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2507	DDI-effect	When other potent parental @DRUG$, such as diazoxide, are used in combination with @DRUG$, patients should be continuously observed for several hours for any excessive fall in blood pressure.
2508	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
2509	DDI-effect	Veratrum alkaloids: @DRUG$ inhibit the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
2510	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2511	DDI-mechanism	Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some @DRUG$) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
2512	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2513	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combined use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should generally be avoided.
2514	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
2515	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
2516	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, @DRUG$, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2517	DDI-mechanism	"Oral contraceptives: @DRUG$, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of @DRUG$ and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43%, and decreased the AUC of norethindrone by 8%;"
2518	DDI-effect	Diuretic: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$, produces a reduction in urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone.
2519	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, @DRUG$, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2520	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, @DRUG$, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
2521	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2522	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, @DRUG$, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2523	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other @DRUG$, concomitant administration of Ponstel and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
2524	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
2525	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2526	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.
2527	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate @DRUG$- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
2528	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral @DRUG$ are given.
2529	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
2530	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving @DRUG$, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary.
2531	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2532	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of enalapril and @DRUG$ IV is augmented by @DRUG$ that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).
2533	DDI-effect	Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue @DRUG$ after concurrent high-dose @DRUG$ therapy.
2534	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease emetic response to @DRUG$.
2535	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, @DRUG$, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2536	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2537	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of rifampicin (or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
2538	DDI-effect	The treatment of ewes with an intravenous (IV) injection of @DRUG$, insufficient to produce significant inhibition of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, appeared to produce additive effects with those produced by subsequent treatment with 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg/day.
2539	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2540	DDI-effect	Blunting of the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs including @DRUG$ has been reported.
2541	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
2542	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (@DRUG$) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2543	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
2544	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2545	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
2546	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2547	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and @DRUG$.
2548	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
2549	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2550	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
2551	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2552	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
2553	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (@DRUG$, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2554	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
2555	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, @DRUG$ GI motility agents: cisapride
2556	DDI-effect	Levodopa and Amantadine: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with either @DRUG$ or amantadine.
2557	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of @DRUG$s and the muscle relaxant effects of aminoglycosides.

2559	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2560	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, @DRUG$, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2561	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2562	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
2563	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.
2564	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain @DRUG$ or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
2565	DDI-effect	Cholinesterase Inhibitors: @DRUG$ may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of @DRUG$, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
2566	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2567	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
2568	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
2569	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with @DRUG$ or Norpace CR, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
2570	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: May decrease @DRUG$ anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors.
2571	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
2572	DDI-effect	Although BETAGAN used alone has little or no effect on pupil size, mydriasis resulting from concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may occur.
2573	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
2574	DDI-mechanism	or with multivitamins containing @DRUG$ may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue @DRUG$ concentrations.
2575	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
2576	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block @DRUG$-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2577	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as @DRUG$, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2578	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
2579	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
2580	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
2581	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2582	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the clearance of chronic high dose @DRUG$.
2583	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
2584	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2585	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2586	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2587	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2588	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
2589	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
2590	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2591	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
2592	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
2593	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
2594	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
2595	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2596	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2597	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs.
2598	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), @DRUG$ (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2599	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of @DRUG$ in both dietary cobalt treatments.
2600	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
2601	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
2602	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for norethindrone and @DRUG$.
2603	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may interfere with the anti-glaucoma action of @DRUG$ or pilocarpine;"
2604	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including @DRUG$, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
2605	DDI-effect	Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to intravenous @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported.
2606	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2607	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may interact with the @DRUG$ preparation causing a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the idoxuridine preparation causing a toxic effect in the eye.
2608	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2609	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
2610	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, @DRUG$, vitamin D.
2611	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, @DRUG$, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
2612	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
2613	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
2614	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2615	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Has a synergistic effect with @DRUG$ in causing gastrointestinal bleeding.
2616	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases.
2617	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
2618	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in 50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations.
2619	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
2620	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
2621	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
2622	DDI-advise	Therefore, when using doses of @DRUG$ greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of @DRUG$ may be required.
2623	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
2624	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2625	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen: A report of severe @DRUG$ toxicity was reported in a patient receiving @DRUG$.
2626	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2627	DDI-effect	Exaggerated hypertensive responses have been reported from the combined use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including those contained in proprietary cold remedies and vasoconstrictive nasal drops.
2628	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;@DRUG$;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2629	DDI-effect	Interactions for Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Antihypertensive Therapy: @DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$ and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension.
2630	DDI-mechanism	Milk, milk products, and @DRUG$-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of @DRUG$.
2631	DDI-mechanism	Enhanced @DRUG$ clearance secondary to @DRUG$ therapy.
2632	DDI-effect	This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity when @DRUG$ is withdrawn.
2633	DDI-effect	Olanzapine: Coadministration of @DRUG$ 3 mg and @DRUG$ 10 mg produced a decrease in DSST scores.
2634	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
2635	DDI-effect	therefore, the efficacy of oral @DRUG$ during administration of @DRUG$ may be reduced.
2636	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and @DRUG$-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2637	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
2638	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2639	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2640	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
2641	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
2642	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
2643	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2644	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.

2659	DDI-mechanism	Milk, milk products, and @DRUG$-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of @DRUG$.
2660	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with @DRUG$ can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of treatment with captopril (captopril tablets, USP) or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg).
2661	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2662	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.

2674	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
2675	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2676	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
2677	DDI-advise	Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.

2767	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold.
2768	DDI-effect	Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high-@DRUG$ rats were supersensitive to @DRUG$ when compared to vehicle-, progesterone- and progesterone + high-estradiol-treated rats (pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12, 7.21+/-0.13, 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18, respectively).
2769	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
2770	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$, causing increased sedative effects.
2771	DDI-effect	Due to their similar mechanism of action, it is expected that the neuromuscular blockade produced by any of the @DRUG$ could be prolonged in the presence of @DRUG$.
2772	DDI-effect	However, it has been established that @DRUG$ interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$ minipill preparations.
2773	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2774	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, quinine, @DRUG$ and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.
2775	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
2776	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates and other sedatives
2777	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedatives.
2778	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2779	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, @DRUG$, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

2781	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ may lower @DRUG$ plasma levels, possibly by competing for protein-binding sites.
2782	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2783	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2784	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$ and losartan.
2785	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
2786	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
2787	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
2788	DDI-effect	Combined treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation.
2789	DDI-effect	Sildenafil citrate - Theoretically, @DRUG$ supplements taken concomitantly with @DRUG$, may potentiate the effects of the drug.
2790	DDI-effect	In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2791	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ not only block the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients.
2792	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ inhibited the @DRUG$-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase due to release from the Ca(2+) store.
2793	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
2794	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
2795	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.

2797	DDI-effect	"In Europe, @DRUG$  was observed to occasionally intensify the effect of @DRUG$ taken concomitantly by patients suffering from hypertension;"
2798	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general @DRUG$) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
2799	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2800	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
2801	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and aluminum-containing @DRUG$, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2802	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
2803	DDI-mechanism	The steady state plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day.
2804	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2805	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, @DRUG$, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
2806	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells, but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of @DRUG$ when both are added simultaneously.
2807	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
2808	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2809	DDI-mechanism	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because @DRUG$ increases the rate of excretion of @DRUG$, the concomitant use of Nalfon and salicylates is not recommended.
2810	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
2811	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or @DRUG$ (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2812	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, Innovar Vet, or @DRUG$, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
2813	DDI-advise	Based on these data, @DRUG$ should not be used in patients on @DRUG$ therapy.
2814	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and @DRUG$, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
2815	DDI-effect	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may render these contraceptives less effective.
2816	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either amiodarone or @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
2817	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
2818	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of @DRUG$ such as dopamine or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
2819	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2820	DDI-mechanism	The clearance of @DRUG$ may be increased with concurrent use of @DRUG$.
2821	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
2822	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, @DRUG$, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2823	DDI-effect	The onset of neuromuscular blockade by @DRUG$ was unaffected by @DRUG$, but the duration of neuromuscular blockade was prolonged from 5 minutes to 8 minutes.
2824	DDI-mechanism	Plasma levels of @DRUG$ may become subtherapeutic during @DRUG$ therapy.
2825	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2826	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, @DRUG$, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2827	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and @DRUG$, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
2828	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use with @DRUG$ or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
2829	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
2830	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
2831	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
2832	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
2833	DDI-effect	However, the antagonism of the @DRUG$-induced anxiogenic effects by @DRUG$ was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
2834	DDI-mechanism	Patients taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of disopyramide resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
2835	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2836	DDI-effect	The prior administration of @DRUG$ does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$.
2837	DDI-effect	Studies in rats have shown that @DRUG$ administration attenuates certain types of adrenocortical steroid dependent hypertension, including @DRUG$ hypertension.
2838	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased to approximately 3.6-fold of control and half-life increased to 1.7-fold of control.
2839	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, @DRUG$, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2840	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (@DRUG$ such as ranitidine or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
2841	DDI-effect	Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the @DRUG$ of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of @DRUG$, it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly.
2842	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2843	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
2844	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
2845	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, @DRUG$, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2846	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$ analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
2847	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
2848	DDI-effect	"Drugs that have been reported to diminish oral @DRUG$ response, ie, decreased prothrom-bin time response, in man significantly include: @DRUG$;"
2849	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2850	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: @DRUG$ and paroxetine.
2851	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
2852	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2853	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
2854	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral @DRUG$, warfarin, or its derivatives.
2855	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2856	DDI-effect	In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of @DRUG$-related toxicity when given supplemental @DRUG$ at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day.
2857	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
2858	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2859	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
2860	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
2861	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2862	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
2863	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.

2865	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
2866	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
2867	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of @DRUG$, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone.
2868	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$ salts and digoxin).
2869	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with @DRUG$, including ibuprofen, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
2870	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
2871	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the activity of other @DRUG$.
2872	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and Corticotropin (@DRUG$): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.

2875	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, the effects of @DRUG$ on travelers receiving comedication, particularly diabetics or patients using @DRUG$, should be checked before departure.
2876	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other members of the @DRUG$.
2877	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2878	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
2879	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
2880	DDI-effect	Antihypertensive Medications and Vasodilators: The following adverse events were experienced more commonly in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ or @DRUG$ (n = 94) compared to patients not receiving these concomitant drugs (n = 456): hypotension 10% vs 4%, myocardial infarction 3% vs 1%, serious pneumonia 5% vs 3%, serious falls 9% vs 3%, and bone and joint injuries 6% vs 2%.
2881	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, tranquilizers, and @DRUG$.

2883	DDI-effect	There have been isolated reports of patients experiencing increases in their prothrombin times when @DRUG$ was added to @DRUG$ therapy.
2884	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2885	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2886	DDI-mechanism	However, @DRUG$ anesthetic requirement (i.e., MAC) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56% 1-2 hours and as much as 14% 5-6 hours after injection of @DRUG$, 50 mg/kg, im.
2887	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
2888	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, @DRUG$, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2889	DDI-advise	Theophylline serum levels should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments considered for patients given both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2890	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
2891	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

2895	DDI-effect	Aortic rings with intact endothelium from the high-dose (4 mg/kg/day) @DRUG$ group were supersensitive to @DRUG$ compared to the vehicle or low-dose (10 microg/kg/day) estradiol groups (pD2 values = 7.86+/-0.09, 7.30+/-0.11 and 7.35+/-0.04, respectively).
2896	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
2897	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
2898	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, @DRUG$, theophylline, vitamin D.

2903	DDI-effect	Digitalis: @DRUG$ may potentiate the toxic effects of @DRUG$.
2904	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
2905	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
2906	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.

2917	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
2918	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2919	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.

2921	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
2922	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
2923	DDI-effect	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
2924	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC values by 14%.
2925	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2926	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$ and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
2927	DDI-advise	Oral Anticoagulants CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN @DRUG$ ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH @DRUG$.
2928	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or @DRUG$ may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
2929	DDI-int	Medications can interfere with folate utilization, including: anticonvulsant medications (such as phenytoin, and primidone) metformin (sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes) sulfasalazine (used to control inflammation associated with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) triamterene (a diuretic) Methotrexate There has been concern about the interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2930	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ are given to patients receiving @DRUG$, hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crises, may occur.

2933	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has led to elevated plasma concentrations of terfenadine, resulting in rare instances of life- threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and one death.
2934	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
2935	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2936	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2937	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
2938	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
2939	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2940	DDI-mechanism	Single doses of either cholestyramine or @DRUG$ resins bind the @DRUG$ and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
2941	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (beta-blockers) and @DRUG$ may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently.
2942	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2943	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
2944	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2945	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2946	DDI-advise	For example, when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
2947	DDI-advise	Based on the chemical resemblance of itraconazole and ketoconazole, coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2948	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, @DRUG$, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
2949	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of enalapril and @DRUG$ IV is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., @DRUG$).
2950	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
2951	DDI-effect	Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.
2952	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
2953	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, co-administration of probenecid with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
2954	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
2955	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
2956	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other @DRUG$ and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).
2957	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
2958	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
2959	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
2960	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
2961	DDI-effect	Medroxyprogesterone Acetate - @DRUG$ was observed to enhance (in tissue culture) the effect of @DRUG$ in reducing the number of human breast cancer cells that were in the S phase.
2962	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2963	DDI-effect	This may indicate that @DRUG$ could enhance the toxicity of @DRUG$.
2964	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
2965	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2966	DDI-effect	However, reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
2967	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
2968	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, @DRUG$ chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2969	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2970	DDI-effect	Benazepril, like other @DRUG$, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
2971	DDI-effect	It was observed that @DRUG$ induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by @DRUG$ pretreatment.
2972	DDI-effect	Digitalis: @DRUG$ may potentiate the toxic effects of @DRUG$.
2973	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2974	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2975	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
2976	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of @DRUG$ capsules (250 mg) with @DRUG$ (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.
2977	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2978	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both @DRUG$ and T3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
2979	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2980	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
2981	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, dexamethasone, @DRUG$) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2982	DDI-effect	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when @DRUG$ was administered with @DRUG$, the concomitant use of apomorphine with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2983	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2984	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, methyldopa and @DRUG$.
2985	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
2986	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of @DRUG$s and the muscle relaxant effects of aminoglycosides.
2987	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
2988	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
2989	DDI-mechanism	Mineral Oil-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2990	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2991	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ and antihypertensive agents.
2992	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as @DRUG$, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
2993	DDI-effect	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis.
2994	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
2995	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2996	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
2997	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
2998	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of single, oral doses of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (10 mg and 800 mg, respectively), a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor produced a 34% increase in zaleplons maximal plasma concentrations and a 20% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
2999	DDI-effect	1- adrenergic receptor antagonism, @DRUG$ has the potential to enhance the effect of certain @DRUG$.
3000	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Has a synergistic effect with @DRUG$ in causing gastrointestinal bleeding.
3001	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an @DRUG$ (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3002	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.
3003	DDI-mechanism	Treatment with @DRUG$ once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy subjects was associated with an inhibition of P450 1A2 and a 25% increase in @DRUG$ AUC.
3004	DDI-effect	Epidural @DRUG$ may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local @DRUG$, including both sensory and motor blockade.
3005	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, @DRUG$, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
3006	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to @DRUG$ and angiotensin II receptor antagonists increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).
3007	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3008	DDI-effect	Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3009	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or @DRUG$ (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
3010	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
3011	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
3012	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (Depen, @DRUG$), another arthritis medication.
3013	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;@DRUG$;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3014	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3015	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine Grepafloxacin, like other @DRUG$, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3016	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/@DRUG$ or zidovudine.
3017	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$ ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
3018	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other @DRUG$, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3019	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3020	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3021	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
3022	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3023	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
3024	DDI-effect	There is thus an enhancement effect of @DRUG$ upon the reaction of placental vessels to @DRUG$ in vitro.
3025	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3026	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
3027	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;@DRUG$;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3028	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3029	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
3030	DDI-effect	In one controlled clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including @DRUG$, were reported to prolong the action of @DRUG$.
3031	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and @DRUG$, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
3032	DDI-mechanism	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the rate of elimination of @DRUG$ (by approximately 50%) by the same mechanism.
3033	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
3034	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3035	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
3036	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3037	DDI-effect	There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3038	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3039	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3040	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
3041	DDI-effect	Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were used in combination.
3042	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3043	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3044	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that disulfiram may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
3045	DDI-effect	There are case reports of patients who developed increased BUN, serum creatinine and serum potassium levels, and weight gain when @DRUG$ was used in conjunction with @DRUG$.
3046	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3047	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3048	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (@DRUG$, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3049	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
3050	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
3051	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3052	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, @DRUG$, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.

3054	DDI-mechanism	Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
3055	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by @DRUG$, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3056	DDI-advise	Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for @DRUG$ when coadministered with @DRUG$.
3057	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic @DRUG$, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3058	DDI-advise	If you are also using a steroid inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the @DRUG$ inhaler.
3059	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3060	DDI-mechanism	Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ AUC by about 2/3.
3061	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3062	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
3063	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Since both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated.
3064	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
3065	DDI-advise	Blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3066	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of nitrofurantoin is not recommended since @DRUG$ may antagonize the antibacterial effect of @DRUG$ in the urinary tract.
3067	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
3068	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
3069	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ could exaggerate the depression of AV nodal conduction observed with @DRUG$.
3070	DDI-effect	Cyclopropane or @DRUG$ increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered @DRUG$, such as dopamine.
3071	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
3072	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3073	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
3074	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
3075	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3076	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3077	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3078	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or inhalation general anesthetics.
3079	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3080	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
3081	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$s, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some @DRUG$ may result in severe hypertension.
3082	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3083	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3084	DDI-mechanism	In two clinical studies, @DRUG$ (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by approximately 35%.
3085	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3086	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3087	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3088	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3089	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3090	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3091	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3092	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
3093	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
3094	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic or @DRUG$;"
3095	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ doubled the AUC for @DRUG$.
3096	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other @DRUG$, concomitant administration of Ponstel and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
3097	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3098	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as phenytoin or @DRUG$ from their binding sites.
3099	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ accelerates the metabolism of @DRUG$;"
3100	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
3101	DDI-advise	Therefore, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-like drugs simultaneously.
3102	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
3103	DDI-effect	Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3104	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and @DRUG$ (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3105	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
3106	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, @DRUG$ (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3107	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
3108	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
3109	DDI-int	The in vitro interaction between @DRUG$ and the antithrombotic agent @DRUG$ is complex.
3110	DDI-mechanism	"Potential for reduction in @DRUG$ and/or @DRUG$ plasma levels;"
3111	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
3112	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3113	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ because of the possibility of ototoxicity.
3114	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
3115	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3116	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
3117	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
3118	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
3119	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3120	DDI-mechanism	HIV Protease Inhibitors: @DRUG$ (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life.
3121	DDI-mechanism	Withdrawal of @DRUG$ decreased the @DRUG$ requirement by 50%.
3122	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, @DRUG$, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3123	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, @DRUG$.
3124	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including nalidixic acid, may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
3125	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., @DRUG$), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3126	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
3127	DDI-effect	There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of insulin or oral @DRUG$ in the presence of @DRUG$ that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
3128	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3129	DDI-effect	The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
3130	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145 mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
3131	DDI-effect	Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3132	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.
3133	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3134	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, @DRUG$ and nefazadone) .
3135	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3136	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational anesthetics such as @DRUG$ are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3137	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3138	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to ACE inhibitors and @DRUG$ increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).
3139	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ tablets and other @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.
3140	DDI-effect	Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$-type drugs.
3141	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3142	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., @DRUG$, glycosides) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
3143	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3144	DDI-effect	It was shown that @DRUG$ antagonized evidently the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ and their analogue.
3145	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3146	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
3147	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., @DRUG$), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3148	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3149	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3150	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, @DRUG$ or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
3151	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
3152	DDI-effect	Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
3153	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
3154	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (@DRUG$), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3155	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
3156	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3157	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3158	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3159	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
3160	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, @DRUG$, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3161	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
3162	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ 30 mg and @DRUG$, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.
3163	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may block the antihypertensive action of @DRUG$ and similarly acting compounds.
3164	DDI-effect	However, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of CELEBREX alone.
3165	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
3166	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$.
3167	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
3168	DDI-effect	Glyburide: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with the sulfonylurea @DRUG$ has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.
3169	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
3170	DDI-mechanism	In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between @DRUG$ (a benzodiazepine) and @DRUG$ under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product.
3171	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
3172	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3173	DDI-mechanism	However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of @DRUG$ nasal spray.
3174	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain @DRUG$, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3175	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3176	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
3177	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3178	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
3179	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., @DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
3180	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3181	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., @DRUG$), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
3182	DDI-mechanism	Pre-treatment with the CYP3A4 inducer @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ AUC by about 2/3.
3183	DDI-advise	Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.
3184	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., phenytoin, @DRUG$, cimetidine, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied
3185	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
3186	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
3187	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
3188	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3189	DDI-mechanism	The @DRUG$ steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to 5 1 micrograms/mL when @DRUG$ (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered.
3190	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on the @DRUG$ requirement of our patient appeared to be maximal 5 to 7 days after the initiation of rifampin and extended a similar length of time after rifampin withdrawal.
3191	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
3192	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
3193	DDI-effect	Doxorubicin: @DRUG$ caused a decrease in @DRUG$ phosphorylation ( 50% inhibition of total phosphate formation) in U937/Molt 4 cells.
3194	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3195	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
3196	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
3197	DDI-effect	Imipramine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
3198	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
3199	DDI-effect	@DRUG$  (levamisole hydrochloride) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3200	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3201	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3202	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril or @DRUG$ can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.
3203	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
3204	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3205	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and @DRUG$.
3206	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either @DRUG$, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or codeine.
3207	DDI-mechanism	In a single subject given one dose of @DRUG$ 2 hours after a dose of @DRUG$-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.
3208	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
3209	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, @DRUG$, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3210	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3211	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3212	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
3213	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3214	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, @DRUG$, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3215	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3216	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like @DRUG$ (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
3217	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
3218	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3219	DDI-effect	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3220	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3221	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or other @DRUG$.
3222	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
3223	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of @DRUG$ bioavailability.
3224	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
3225	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other members of the @DRUG$.
3226	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic @DRUG$ abuse, reserpine
3227	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
3228	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
3229	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
3230	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3231	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
3232	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of @DRUG$ and levodopa.
3233	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, @DRUG$.
3234	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3235	DDI-effect	Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3236	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
3237	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
3238	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
3239	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3240	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
3241	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3242	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3243	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ modifies @DRUG$ metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin.
3244	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
3245	DDI-advise	It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ containing antacids for at least 4 hours following ethambutol administration.
3246	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3247	DDI-effect	A potential interaction between oral @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
3248	DDI-effect	- The action of @DRUG$ and insulin may be enhanced by Bezalip or @DRUG$.
3249	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactercidal effect of @DRUG$ and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
3250	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
3251	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (@DRUG$), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3252	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ and other sedatives
3253	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, caffeine, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
3254	DDI-effect	@DRUG$-induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by vitamin E or @DRUG$.
3255	DDI-effect	Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: @DRUG$ attenuates potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
3256	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the @DRUG$ and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3257	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3258	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants, most notably @DRUG$, and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is reduced by concomitant administration of N 2O.
3259	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3260	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3261	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and @DRUG$, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3262	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
3263	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
3264	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3265	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3266	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
3267	DDI-effect	Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: @DRUG$ can attenuate potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
3268	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3269	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3270	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3271	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as @DRUG$, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3272	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
3273	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3274	DDI-effect	There is thus an enhancement effect of @DRUG$ upon the reaction of placental vessels to @DRUG$ in vitro.
3275	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3276	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
3277	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3278	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3279	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
3280	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3281	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of @DRUG$.

3336	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
3337	DDI-effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ but may be seen after several months.
3338	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may elevate @DRUG$ levels.
3339	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with @DRUG$
3340	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3341	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3342	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.

3344	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3345	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving @DRUG$, procaine, or thiazolesulfone.
3346	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of @DRUG$, barbiturates or other sedating drugs.
3347	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$, cautious titration is advised.

3351	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other @DRUG$ metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3352	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
3353	DDI-advise	- @DRUG$ or MAO-inhibitors (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
3354	DDI-effect	Since animal studies suggest that the action of @DRUG$ may be prolonged by therapy with @DRUG$, barbiturates should be employed with caution.
3355	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that @DRUG$ like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
3356	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$ and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3357	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.

3361	DDI-mechanism	The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day.
3362	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or @DRUG$ may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3363	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (600 mg b.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 13-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax.
3364	DDI-effect	Thioridazine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
3365	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3366	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP.
3367	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
3368	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3369	DDI-mechanism	Ephedrine: @DRUG$ may enhance the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
3370	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may not be effective due to decreased @DRUG$ concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.
3371	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.

3374	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
3375	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
3376	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ usually depresses @DRUG$ activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
3377	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (Desyrel) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
3378	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine resin may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of drugs that undergo enterohepatic circulation, The discontinuance of @DRUG$ resin could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug such as @DRUG$ has been filtrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking cholestyramine resin.
3379	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of @DRUG$ (300 m g/mL), the binding of @DRUG$ was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels.
3380	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of @DRUG$ may be required or adenosine may not be effective.
3381	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
3382	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the @DRUG$ C max by 23% and ceftibuten AUC by 16%.
3383	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.

3385	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, @DRUG$, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3386	DDI-advise	If additional @DRUG$ are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated.
3387	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
3388	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3389	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents.
3390	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, @DRUG$

3392	DDI-mechanism	In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg @DRUG$ and 12 g @DRUG$ resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
3393	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the activity of other @DRUG$.
3394	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ may potentiate the undesirable effects of @DRUG$.
3395	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
3396	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3397	DDI-effect	Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of @DRUG$ to @DRUG$, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects
3398	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3399	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3400	DDI-mechanism	Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when @DRUG$ was given with @DRUG$.
3401	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
3402	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of naloxone at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin, and a high dose of @DRUG$ (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ (16 micrograms).
3403	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., @DRUG$), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
3404	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
3405	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg injected with @DRUG$ was found to decrease the antinociceptive effect of morphine.
3406	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
3407	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ 1/35  increased the exposure of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 20% and 34%, respectively.
3408	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ are given in conjunction with @DRUG$.
3409	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3410	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3411	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
3412	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3413	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3414	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
3415	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
3416	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, @DRUG$, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3417	DDI-mechanism	Use with Allopurinol: The principal pathway for detoxification of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
3418	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3419	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and @DRUG$ resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3420	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
3421	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3422	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, @DRUG$, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3423	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
3424	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3425	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: @DRUG$
3426	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3427	DDI-int	A possible drug interaction of @DRUG$ and intravenous @DRUG$ has been described.
3428	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in @DRUG$.
3429	DDI-effect	Although beta-adrenergic blockers or @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
3430	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactams, the renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
3431	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3432	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen.
3433	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
3434	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and @DRUG$) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3435	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of @DRUG$.
3436	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose @DRUG$ coadministration leads to higher @DRUG$ exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus.
3437	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
3438	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3439	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ along with either oral or intravenous @DRUG$ should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension.
3440	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3441	DDI-effect	Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of @DRUG$ to treat strongyloidiasis during the @DRUG$ cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
3442	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, @DRUG$, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3443	DDI-advise	If it is necessary to continue the @DRUG$, initiate therapy with @DRUG$ at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized.
3444	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, @DRUG$.
3445	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with benzodiazepines or @DRUG$.
3446	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3447	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of alcohol, @DRUG$, and other CNS depressants.
3448	DDI-mechanism	The absorption of oral @DRUG$ is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an antacid containing aluminum and @DRUG$.
3449	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease the amount of @DRUG$ (Lanoxin, Lanoxicaps) that gets absorbed into your body.
3450	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain @DRUG$ or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
3451	DDI-advise	Considerable caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with @DRUG$ (phenacemide) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
3452	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: @DRUG$ and kaolin can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
3453	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3454	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3455	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
3456	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3457	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as @DRUG$ and erythromycin with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
3458	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
3459	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving @DRUG$ 450 mg BID with @DRUG$ 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.
3460	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
3461	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
3462	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3463	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3464	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3465	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
3466	DDI-mechanism	At higher than recommended doses, @DRUG$ 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving @DRUG$ 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
3467	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
3468	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
3469	DDI-advise	- @DRUG$ or MAO-inhibitors (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
3470	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, renal excretion of loracarbef is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
3471	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3472	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3473	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3474	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3475	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
3476	DDI-advise	Particular caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., @DRUG$ or pimozide).
3477	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
3478	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3479	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3480	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered (at a dose of 60 mg BID) in conjunction with a single 50-mg dose of @DRUG$, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
3481	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with HEXALEN and/or @DRUG$.1
3482	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3483	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, @DRUG$) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3484	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
3485	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
3486	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, @DRUG$(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3487	DDI-advise	Standard monitoring of methotrexate-related toxicity should be continued if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3488	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3489	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3490	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3491	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with @DRUG$ or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
3492	DDI-advise	Patients with major psychotic disorders, treated with @DRUG$, should be treated with @DRUG$ only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
3493	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3494	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3495	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
3496	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
3497	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life.
3498	DDI-mechanism	Metoprolol - Administration of 20 mg/day @DRUG$ for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50% increase in Cmax and 82% increase in AUC of the beta-adrenergic blocker @DRUG$ (given in a single dose of 100 mg).
3499	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3500	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, @DRUG$ (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3501	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
3502	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
3503	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3504	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, @DRUG$, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3505	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, @DRUG$ (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3506	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3507	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, @DRUG$, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3508	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing @DRUG$, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3509	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and aluminum-containing @DRUG$, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
3510	DDI-advise	If you are also using a steroid inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the @DRUG$ inhaler.
3511	DDI-advise	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because aspirin increases the rate of excretion of Nalfon, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3512	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with @DRUG$ and lithium.
3513	DDI-mechanism	The serum estrogen concentrations of @DRUG$ + @DRUG$-treated rats decreased by 50%, while those of the endotoxin-treated rats increased (2- to 5-fold).
3514	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3515	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve.
3516	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that @DRUG$ clearance is 60% greater in patients taking @DRUG$ with or without other enzyme- inducing AEDs.
3517	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
3518	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
3519	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
3520	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and glutethimide should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
3521	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
3522	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
3523	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3524	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3525	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3526	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3527	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3528	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3529	DDI-advise	therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3530	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
3531	DDI-mechanism	In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the @DRUG$ was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3532	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.

3534	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
3535	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3536	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concurrently increases @DRUG$ anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.
3537	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and @DRUG$.
3538	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3539	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
3540	DDI-mechanism	Orlistat-@DRUG$ may decrease the absorption of @DRUG$.
3541	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving @DRUG$ (disulfiram, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
3542	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, @DRUG$ for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
3543	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as @DRUG$ or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3544	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
3545	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, @DRUG$, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3546	DDI-advise	Because @DRUG$ have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on @DRUG$ therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
3547	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
3548	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used cautiously in conjunction with @DRUG$ in hypoprothrombinemia.
3549	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3550	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
3551	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3552	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and @DRUG$ may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3553	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3554	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
3555	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: @DRUG$ may raise serum @DRUG$ levels in some individuals.
3556	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3557	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3558	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3559	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
3560	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.
3561	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3562	DDI-advise	Microdosed minipill @DRUG$ preparations are not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
3563	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3564	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
3565	DDI-advise	The IV @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
3566	DDI-mechanism	"Potential for reduction in @DRUG$ and/or @DRUG$ plasma levels;"
3567	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple-dose study, @DRUG$ caused a dose-related increase in the mean elimination half-life of @DRUG$, thereby decreasing the clearance of caffeine by up to 80% and leading to a five-fold increase in the AUC and the half-life of caffeine.
3568	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3569	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ may reduce plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3570	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3571	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and @DRUG$.
3572	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
3573	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
3574	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
3575	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3576	DDI-mechanism	Saquinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with @DRUG$ resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
3577	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
3578	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and @DRUG$.
3579	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3580	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
3581	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
3582	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
3583	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
3584	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
3585	DDI-advise	Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing @DRUG$ therapy in patients receiving @DRUG$ or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.
3586	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3587	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, @DRUG$, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3588	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3589	DDI-advise	Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for @DRUG$ when coadministered with @DRUG$.
3590	DDI-mechanism	However, patients on @DRUG$ may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
3591	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or @DRUG$, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3592	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3593	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
3594	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3595	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
3596	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
3597	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used together.
3598	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
3599	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.
3600	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin).
3601	DDI-mechanism	Midazolam: @DRUG$ increased the AUC of @DRUG$, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, by 2.3-fold on Day 1 and 3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg was coadministered on Day 1 and Day 5 of a regimen of Aprepitant 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 through 5.
3602	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3603	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3604	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3605	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
3606	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3607	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, @DRUG$ and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3608	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with @DRUG$ (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
3609	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3610	DDI-int	conversely, @DRUG$ may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (i.e., guanethidine, @DRUG$).
3611	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3612	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (@DRUG$, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3613	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., @DRUG$), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
3614	DDI-mechanism	Alkalinizing agents: Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (@DRUG$, etc.) increase absorption of @DRUG$.
3615	DDI-mechanism	Extended Release Tablets: Administration of nifedipine with @DRUG$ increased @DRUG$ levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers.
3616	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as @DRUG$, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

3621	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3622	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (@DRUG$), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3623	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, vaiproic acid, and sodium valproate.
3624	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
3625	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, @DRUG$, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3626	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3627	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3628	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with Bezalip or @DRUG$ retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3629	DDI-mechanism	Furthermore it has been proposed that @DRUG$ resulted In induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested @DRUG$ being converted to the toxic metabolites.
3630	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: In healthy subjects receiving the CYP3A4 inducer, @DRUG$, at 100 mg twice daily for 3 days and 200 mg twice daily for 17 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was decreased approximately 72%.
3631	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, @DRUG$, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3632	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3633	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
3634	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, @DRUG$, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3635	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
3636	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3637	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3638	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other @DRUG$ cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
3639	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, @DRUG$, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3640	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
3641	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3642	DDI-mechanism	There is a significant increase in exposure to imatinib when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (CYP3A4 inhibitor).
3643	DDI-mechanism	Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and Lodine  (@DRUG$ capsules and tablets) results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin.
3644	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
3645	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of @DRUG$ elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of Betaseron on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown.
3646	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3647	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
3648	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3649	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3650	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
3651	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3652	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations (AUC 0-24 hrs) of @DRUG$ decreased 15% with coadministration of @DRUG$ relative to that observed with erythromycin alone.
3653	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3654	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing @DRUG$ or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3655	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
3656	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: @DRUG$ metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3657	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may also decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, which can lead to a deficiency.
3658	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
3659	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
3660	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3661	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3662	DDI-mechanism	Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of @DRUG$ in anhydrous and aqueous @DRUG$ solutions.
3663	DDI-advise	Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of @DRUG$ while under treatment with SUBOXONE or @DRUG$.
3664	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
3665	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3666	DDI-mechanism	1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10% 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high Trileptal doses In vivo, the plasma levels of @DRUG$ increased by up to 40%, when @DRUG$ was given at doses above 1200 mg/day.
3667	DDI-int	Thus, the interaction observed between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not expected for dirithromycin.
3668	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, @DRUG$, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3669	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
3670	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
3671	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3672	DDI-advise	In the case that you are taking @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, higher doses of digoxin may be needed.
3673	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3674	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3675	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3676	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3677	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
3678	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
3679	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
3680	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, @DRUG$, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3681	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3682	DDI-mechanism	A drug-drug interaction study with @DRUG$ in healthy volunteers has shown a 30% decrease in @DRUG$ trough concentrations.
3683	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (@DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3684	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
3685	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
3686	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3687	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of HEXALEN and antidepressants of the MAO inhibitor class may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.@DRUG$, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased @DRUG$s half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
3688	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
3689	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3690	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
3691	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.
3692	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$ (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
3693	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3694	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
3695	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3696	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
3697	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3698	DDI-advise	If intravenous @DRUG$ is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with @DRUG$ should be interrupted.
3699	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the zidovudine tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated @DRUG$ by 110%.
3700	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
3701	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3702	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3703	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduces urinary excretion of @DRUG$ and may enhance its effect.
3704	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of R-warfarin and @DRUG$ (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3705	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3706	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3707	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
3708	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3709	DDI-advise	It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few days after the start and discontinuation of @DRUG$ therapy, with an appropriate adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose, if necessary.
3710	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
3711	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3712	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3713	DDI-advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$.
3714	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered until a patient has recovered from @DRUG$-induced neuromuscular block.
3715	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3716	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3717	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3718	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
3719	DDI-mechanism	Antidepressants: In vitro data indicate that @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3720	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
3721	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that @DRUG$, itraconazole, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3722	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3723	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3724	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
3725	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
3726	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3727	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
3728	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
3729	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, @DRUG$ resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3730	DDI-mechanism	In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of @DRUG$ given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg @DRUG$ increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.
3731	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, @DRUG$, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3732	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
3733	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3734	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3735	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
3736	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
3737	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
3738	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
3739	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).
3740	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ are reported to fluctuate significantly when @DRUG$ is either added or deleted from the drug regimen.
3741	DDI-mechanism	In addition, several @DRUG$ s that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and MHD.
3742	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
3743	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, @DRUG$, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
3744	DDI-mechanism	Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the @DRUG$ have been reported upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant 6.
3745	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
3746	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine
3747	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3748	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3749	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3750	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, @DRUG$s, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3751	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3752	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3753	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3754	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3755	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
3756	DDI-mechanism	Bismuth: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$ or 60 minutes following enoxacin administration, decreased enoxacin bioavailability by approximately 25%.
3757	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and @DRUG$ and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
3758	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
3759	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
3760	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3761	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3762	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
3763	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
3764	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.

3766	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
3767	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine and @DRUG$ is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3768	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, @DRUG$, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone

3772	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3773	DDI-advise	Monitoring for amiodarone toxicity and serial measurement of @DRUG$ serum concentration during concomitant @DRUG$ therapy should be considered.
3774	DDI-mechanism	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ (200 m m M i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17-28%.
3775	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.

3780	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3781	DDI-advise	However, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ since these patients are at increased risk of bleeding complications.
3782	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased @DRUG$ exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.

3785	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and @DRUG$-containing preparations.
3786	DDI-mechanism	Ganciclovir: Administration of @DRUG$ 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral @DRUG$ was associated with a 111 (114)% increase in the steady-state AUC of didanosine (n = 12).
3787	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of adenosine may be required or @DRUG$ may not be effective.
3788	DDI-mechanism	In eight HIV-infected patients, the steady-state AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 26% (95% CI = 14%, 37%) when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of @DRUG$.
3789	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of S(-) warfarin and @DRUG$, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
3790	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.

3794	DDI-advise	Patients using CYP3A4 metabolized @DRUG$ should have cholesterol levels monitored after @DRUG$ is initiated to see whether the statin dose needs adjustment.
3795	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.

3799	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
3800	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3801	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3802	DDI-advise	Patients receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.
3803	DDI-int	A two-way interaction between the @DRUG$, phenytoin, and the @DRUG$s has been suggested.
3804	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other @DRUG$) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3805	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may interact with the @DRUG$ preparation causing a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the idoxuridine preparation causing a toxic effect in the eye.
3806	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and @DRUG$.
3807	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with @DRUG$ (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.
3808	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
3809	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), @DRUG$, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3810	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten C max by 23% and @DRUG$ AUC by 16%.
3811	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, @DRUG$, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3812	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of @DRUG$ and azathioprine to 6-thiouric acid.
3813	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and @DRUG$ and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
3814	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
3815	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
3816	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
3817	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3818	DDI-advise	Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of @DRUG$ should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$ 400 mg daily.
3819	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3820	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3821	DDI-mechanism	Interactions of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in absorption and retention.
3822	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, @DRUG$, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3823	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3824	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3825	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3826	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3827	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3828	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ renal clearance and increases lithium plasma levels.
3829	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Elevated @DRUG$ levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3830	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3831	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3832	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and @DRUG$] is contraindicated.
3833	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, @DRUG$, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3834	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
3835	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3836	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3837	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
3838	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3839	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
3840	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and @DRUG$) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3841	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3842	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3843	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-@DRUG$, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
3844	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
3845	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3846	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3847	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: When multiple doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20%.
3848	DDI-mechanism	Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer @DRUG$ (600 mg every 24 hours, q24h, for 14 days), however, reduced @DRUG$ Cmax and AUC by approximately 80%.
3849	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, @DRUG$, iron salts and digoxin).
3850	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
3851	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
3852	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: Coadministration (N=18) of @DRUG$ capsules (250 mg) with @DRUG$ (125 mg) appears to increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by 12% to 15%.
3853	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3854	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
3855	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3856	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3857	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the @DRUG$ and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
3858	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, @DRUG$ and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3859	DDI-advise	On administration of oral @DRUG$, the need for @DRUG$ therapy should be reviewed and the dose reduced by approximately 50% or discontinued.
3860	DDI-int	A possible drug interaction of @DRUG$ and intravenous @DRUG$ has been described.
3861	DDI-advise	"Patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored;"
3862	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3863	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3864	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), @DRUG$, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3865	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
3866	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3867	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of @DRUG$ was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days.
3868	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of @DRUG$ metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the coumarin anticoagulants and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
3869	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3870	DDI-advise	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by carbamazepine overdose with a positive tricyclic antidepressant level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of @DRUG$ with a toxicology screen for @DRUG$.
3871	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
3872	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite.
3873	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
3874	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any @DRUG$, including Solganal and Myochrysine.

4083	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
4084	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
4085	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
4086	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
4087	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.

4126	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
4127	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption .
4128	DDI-advise	Thus, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided.

4196	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
4197	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is withdrawn from the combination therapy, @DRUG$ dose should then be reduced.
4198	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
4199	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or @DRUG$, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
