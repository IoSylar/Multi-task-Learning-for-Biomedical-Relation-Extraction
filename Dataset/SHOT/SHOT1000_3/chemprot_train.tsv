664	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither @CHEMICAL$ nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a @GENE$-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.

875	CPR:9	The M564G mutated @CHEMICAL$ showed higher activity toward longer chain acyl-CoAs: activity toward @GENE$ was 1250-fold higher than that of the wild-type CrAT, and lower activity toward its natural substrate, acetyl-CoA. Kinetic constants of the mutant CrAT showed modification in favor of longer acyl-CoAs as substrates.
876	CPRFalse	DXM and @CHEMICAL$ attenuated the mRNA expression of E-selectin and iNOS induced by the costimulation of @GENE$, reTNF-alpha, and LPS.
877	CPRFalse	"These data demonstrated that 1) gemcitabine and @CHEMICAL$ synergistically interact against NSCLC cells through the suppression of Akt phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3) pemetrexed enhances dCK and @GENE$ expression, thus suggesting the role of gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations."
878	CPRFalse	Although inhibition of LH release can be achieved by @CHEMICAL$ and progestins, an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of the antiandrogen with an @GENE$ agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular androgen biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the LH responsiveness to LHRH.
879	CPRFalse	The expression of @CHEMICAL$ in WKY and SHR PTE cells and kidney cortices from WKY and SHR was also evaluated. @GENE$ uptake was highly dependent on extracellular Na(+).

885	CPRFalse	Furthermore, a combinatory mutation (Pro(7.31)-Pro(7.32)-Ser(7.33) motif to Ser-Glu-Pro in EL3 and @CHEMICAL$(7.38), Leu(7.43), Ala(7.46), and Pro(7.47) to those of rat GnRHR) in gmGnRH-2 exhibited an approximately 500-fold increased sensitivity to GnRH-I, indicating that these residues are critical for discriminating GnRH-II from GnRH-I. [Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native @GENE$, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.
886	CPRFalse	"The number of times DEX-P was administered was not a significant factor in the induction of either hepatic or intestinal @CHEMICAL$; however, administration of DEX-P multiple times markedly decreased the bioavailability of @GENE$ by self-induction of CYP3A. 3."
887	CPRFalse	Cloning and characterization of a novel human phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP (PDE10A). cDNA encoding a novel @CHEMICAL$ (PDE) was isolated from a human fetal lung cDNA library and designated PDE10A.

888	CPRFalse	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate @CHEMICAL$ secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by @GENE$ was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 mM)."
889	CPRFalse	"In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of TCDD on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of R-spondins (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of @CHEMICAL$, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by @GENE$."

895	CPR:4	These results suggest that @CHEMICAL$ inhibits the induction of iNOS probably by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB, @GENE$, and C/EBPbeta and that gemfibrozil, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.

Result showed that vitamin C treatment resulted in markedly reduced c-Rel nuclear translocation.
924	CPRFalse	Chronic insulin (24 h) activates NHE3 through the classic @CHEMICAL$ 3-kinase-serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (@GENE$-SGK1) pathway as insulin stimulates SGK1 phosphorylation and the insulin effect can be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or a dominant-negative SGK1.
925	CPRFalse	Both inhibitors for PI3K and Akt suppressed the nuclear localization of b-catenin and T-cell factor transcriptional activity induced by Wnt-3a. @CHEMICAL$ increased the amount of osteoprotegerin at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of @GENE$, leading to the mineralization.

930	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of @CHEMICAL$, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. @GENE$ did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.

941	CPR:9	These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating @CHEMICAL$ activity or stability as a part of @GENE$ homeostasis.
942	CPRFalse	"In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered @CHEMICAL$ was observed in @GENE$-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test."
943	CPR:3	Moreover, BH(4) treatment of the fructose-fed rats markedly reduced the lipid peroxide content of both aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2 redox-sensitive transcription factors, @CHEMICAL$ and activating protein-1, which were increased in @GENE$-fed rats.

945	CPRFalse	The rates of @CHEMICAL$ transport for the exogenous steroids methyltrienelone (MET), @GENE$ (NAN), and oxandrolone (OXA) are lower than that of testosterone and similar to those of the endogenous steroids ANE and DHT.
946	CPRFalse	Due to the ubiquitous nature of the @CHEMICAL$ pathway, general inhibitors of cAMP signaling proteins such as PKA, EPAC and @GENE$ would act non-specifically and universally, increasing the likelihood of serious 'off target' effects.
947	CPRFalse	The selectivity that @CHEMICAL$ and other Lp-PLA(2) inhibitors display across the larger @GENE$ family has not, however, been reported.

1254	CPRFalse	In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective NMDA antagonist, @CHEMICAL$, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective NMDA antagonist and the NR2B-specific @GENE$ antagonist.
1255	CPRFalse	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either @CHEMICAL$ or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM.
