0	CPRFalse	For example, @CHEMICAL$ revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the dopamine D4 receptor, agreeing with the value directly measured with [3H]-clozapine at @GENE$.
1	CPR:3	Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by @CHEMICAL$ in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of @GENE$ enzyme.
2	CPR:4	In addition, @CHEMICAL$ blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of IkB, resulting in suppression of the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kB (@GENE$) subunits, namely p65 and p50, which are important molecules involved in the regulation of iNOS expression.
3	CPR:9	The @CHEMICAL$ mutated CrAT showed higher activity toward longer chain acyl-CoAs: activity toward myristoyl-CoA was 1250-fold higher than that of the wild-type CrAT, and lower activity toward its natural substrate, @GENE$. Kinetic constants of the mutant CrAT showed modification in favor of longer acyl-CoAs as substrates.
4	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ (LY139037), a selective @GENE$ antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion.
5	CPR:5	Pharmacology of @CHEMICAL$, a selective @GENE$/MT2 receptor agonist: a novel therapeutic drug for sleep disorders.
