0	DDI-false	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: @DRUG$: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, @DRUG$, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by fluvoxamine.
1	DDI-effect	Selegiline - @DRUG$ and the selective MAO inhibitor @DRUG$ may have synergistic antidepressant activity if used concomitantly.
2	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and cyclosporine, @DRUG$ or digoxin has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
