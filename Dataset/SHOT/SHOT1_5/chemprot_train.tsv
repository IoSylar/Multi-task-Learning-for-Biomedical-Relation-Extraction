0	CPRFalse	We have reported that a deficiency of @CHEMICAL$ (BH(4)), an active cofactor of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), contributes to the endothelial dysfunction through reduced eNOS activity and increased superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) generation in the @GENE$-resistant state.
1	CPR:4	The upregulation of calpain, @CHEMICAL$ and caspase-3 activity were further inhibited by treatment with @GENE$ in the presence of ALD.
2	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ (AKRs) metabolize a wide range of substrates, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (@GENE$), generating metabolites (o-quinones) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are capable of initiating and promoting carcinogenesis.
3	CPR:3	As add-on therapy in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control despite oral antihyperglycaemic treatment, sitagliptin improved @CHEMICAL$ to a significantly greater extent than placebo when added to @GENE$ or pioglitazone and was noninferior to glipizide when added to metformin.
4	CPR:6	However, recent clinical studies have shown that a single low-dose injection of @CHEMICAL$, an @GENE$ (NMDAR) antagonist, has rapid antidepressant effects that are observed within hours and are long lasting.
5	CPR:5	Terbutaline (Bricanyl) and its prodrug Bambuterol (@CHEMICAL$) are highly potent @GENE$ agonists often used in asthma patients.
