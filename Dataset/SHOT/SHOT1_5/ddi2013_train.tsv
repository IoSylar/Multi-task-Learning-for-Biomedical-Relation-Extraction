0	DDI-false	The minimal inhibitory concentrations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ alone and in combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates.
1	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, @DRUG$), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, @DRUG$ (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
4	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
