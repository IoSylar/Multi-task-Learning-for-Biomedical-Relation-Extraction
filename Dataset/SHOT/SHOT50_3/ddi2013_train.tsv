22	DDI-false	The use of @DRUG$ should be considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
23	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
24	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
25	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, @DRUG$ and phenobarbital, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.

34	DDI-false	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and @DRUG$ cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
35	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
36	DDI-false	@DRUG$: In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state @DRUG$ plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg BID with CELEBREX 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.

38	DDI-false	Potential @DRUG$, @DRUG$, and Cisapride Interactions
39	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
40	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, @DRUG$, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
41	DDI-false	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

44	DDI-false	Elevated @DRUG$ serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and cyclosporine.
45	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
46	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
47	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
48	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
49	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
50	DDI-false	These drugs include the @DRUG$ and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid.

53	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
54	DDI-false	Co-administration of lovastatin, atenolol, @DRUG$, furosemide, @DRUG$, celecoxib, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, valsartan, metformin and amlodipine did not result in clinically significant increases in aliskiren exposure.

56	DDI-false	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since escitalopram is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
57	DDI-false	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and digoxin are used concomitantly, serum @DRUG$ levels should be closely monitored.
58	DDI-false	Rifabutin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and VIRACEPT resulted in a 32% decrease in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 207% increase in @DRUG$ plasma A.C.
59	DDI-false	ZEBETA should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
60	DDI-false	However, the absolute number of @DRUG$-related deaths is far greater than the number of deaths in @DRUG$ or heroin users.
61	DDI-false	The following are examples of substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect: corticosteroids, niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine, salbutamol, terbutaline), isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, @DRUG$, estrogens, @DRUG$ (e.g., in oral contraceptives).
62	DDI-false	Potential for @DRUG$ to Affect Other Drugs: Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2: In vitro drug interaction studies demonstrate that @DRUG$ does not induce CYP1A2 activity, and it is unlikely to have a clinically significant effect on the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates.
63	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
64	DDI-false	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, @DRUG$, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving SPRYCEL.

68	DDI-false	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of EQUETROTM are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, @DRUG$, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
69	DDI-false	@DRUG$: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.
70	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: @DRUG$ metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
71	DDI-effect	Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
72	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
73	DDI-mechanism	Resins: Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take @DRUG$ at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption.
74	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
75	DDI-mechanism	"In a ten-subject study, coadministration of @DRUG$ (120 mg bid) with @DRUG$ resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;"
76	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, @DRUG$ and 5-fluorouracil.
77	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including @DRUG$, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
78	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
79	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
80	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
81	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, @DRUG$, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
82	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
83	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
84	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
85	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
86	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
87	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
88	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
89	DDI-effect	Stavudine and Zidovudine @DRUG$ can antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of stavudine and @DRUG$ against HIV.

91	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
92	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either amiodarone or @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
93	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
94	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
95	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
96	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
97	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a neutralizing agent for @DRUG$ that protects against renal damage.
98	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
99	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: A study in 6 healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak nifedipine plasma levels (80%) and area-under-the-curve (74%) after a 1 week course of @DRUG$ at 1000 mg per day and @DRUG$ at 40 mg per day.
100	DDI-effect	Aminoglycosides: The mixing of @DRUG$ with an @DRUG$ in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.
101	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, @DRUG$ salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
102	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
103	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as @DRUG$ and atorvastatin.
104	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
105	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
106	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
107	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral @DRUG$.
108	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
109	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
110	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
111	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
112	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
113	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
114	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
115	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given to a patient receiving @DRUG$, the dosage of warfarin should be reduced to prevent excessive prolongation of the prothrombin time.
116	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
117	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
118	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
119	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.

122	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
123	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
124	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, @DRUG$, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone

127	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
128	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and @DRUG$) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
129	DDI-effect	Phenobarbital toxicity has been reported to have occurred in a patient on chronic @DRUG$ treatment following the initiation of @DRUG$ therapy.
130	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, @DRUG$, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
131	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
132	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
133	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
134	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
135	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
136	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
137	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
138	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
139	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
140	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
141	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other @DRUG$, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
142	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
143	DDI-effect	Synergism has been shown between @DRUG$ anesthesia and intravenously administered @DRUG$.
144	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
145	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
146	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
147	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
148	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
149	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and @DRUG$, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
150	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
151	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
152	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
153	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
154	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace @DRUG$s, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.
155	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
156	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
157	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
158	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
159	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, @DRUG$, vitamin D.
160	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
161	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
162	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
163	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
164	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;"
165	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ decreased the maximum plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by 6%, decreased clearance by 38%, and increased half-life by 58%.
166	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
167	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
168	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
169	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
170	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
171	DDI-mechanism	Ibuprofen - @DRUG$ may increase the absorption of @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
172	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
173	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of @DRUG$ (or rifabutin) and @DRUG$.
174	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
175	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with midazolam or @DRUG$ has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
176	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, @DRUG$, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
177	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral @DRUG$, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
178	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
179	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
180	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, @DRUG$, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
181	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
182	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
183	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
184	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and @DRUG$.
185	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: @DRUG$, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
186	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, @DRUG$ or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
187	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin @DRUG$ midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride

190	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
191	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or @DRUG$-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
192	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), @DRUG$ containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
193	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
194	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.
195	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: @DRUG$, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride

197	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
198	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
199	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
200	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
201	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
202	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
203	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
204	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
205	DDI-advise	Carbamazepine: Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels @DRUG$ levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with @DRUG$, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
206	DDI-advise	A 5-mg @DRUG$ dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with 200 mg once daily @DRUG$.
207	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.

211	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
212	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
213	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
