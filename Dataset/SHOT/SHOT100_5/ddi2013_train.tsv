99	DDI-false	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of @DRUG$ as compared with @DRUG$ administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
100	DDI-false	In addition, steady state levels of racemic @DRUG$ were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on @DRUG$ metabolism.
101	DDI-false	Conjugation at NaCMC with @DRUG$ moieties significantly improves the intestinal permeation of the hydrophilic molecule NaFlu and the model peptide drugs @DRUG$ and insulin in vitro, therefore this conjugated system maybe useful for peroral administration of peptide drugs in the future.

116	DDI-false	"Interactions for @DRUG$ (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of fat soluble vitamins;"
117	DDI-false	Unmodified @DRUG$ (1% m/v) significantly improved the transport ratio (R= P(app) polymer/ P(app) control) of @DRUG$ to 1.3 and 1% (m/v) NaCMC conjugated with cysteine further enhanced the permeation.
118	DDI-false	@DRUG$: In vitro data indicate that nefazodone inhibits the metabolism of cisapride, which can result in an increase in plasma @DRUG$ levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
119	DDI-false	Cardiac Glycosides: In a study of young healthy male subjects no evidence of a direct pharmacokinetic @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction could be found.

124	DDI-mechanism	Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4 Cimetidine: @DRUG$ inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
125	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
126	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by @DRUG$, such as propranolol and metoprolol.
127	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of @DRUG$ may be required or adenosine may not be effective.
128	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
129	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
130	DDI-effect	However, it has been established that @DRUG$ interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$ minipill preparations.
131	DDI-effect	Loperamide and @DRUG$ (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the @DRUG$ (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.

133	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
134	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of @DRUG$ (vitamin C) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
135	DDI-effect	Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue @DRUG$ after concurrent high-dose @DRUG$ therapy.
136	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
137	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
138	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, renal excretion of loracarbef is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
139	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
140	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of delavirdine (20%) and @DRUG$ (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
141	DDI-effect	The blood pressure effect of @DRUG$ tended to be greater in patients on @DRUG$ than in patients on no other antihypertensive therapy.
142	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.

145	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
146	DDI-effect	@DRUG$  (levamisole hydrochloride) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with @DRUG$.
147	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
148	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

150	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
151	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has a tendency to antagonize the skeletal muscle relaxing effect of tubocurarine and may potentiate the action of @DRUG$.
152	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
153	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., @DRUG$), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
154	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
155	DDI-mechanism	Even so @DRUG$ plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of @DRUG$ were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.
156	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
157	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
158	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
159	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
160	DDI-advise	Therefore when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ their dosage should be reduced.
161	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
162	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
163	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
164	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
165	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or @DRUG$, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
166	DDI-effect	Hypotension   Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of @DRUG$.
167	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
168	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
169	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
170	DDI-effect	Adrenergic Agents:Some individuals receiving @DRUG$ may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, @DRUG$ or dopaminergic agents.
171	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"

173	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$-containing minipill preparations.
174	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
175	DDI-advise	Methotrexate: Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
176	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
177	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
178	DDI-effect	Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
179	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased to approximately 3.6-fold of control and half-life increased to 1.7-fold of control.
180	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
181	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
182	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
183	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
184	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, @DRUG$, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
185	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
186	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
187	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
188	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
189	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
190	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
191	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
192	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
193	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
194	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
195	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
196	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
197	DDI-effect	Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., @DRUG$), ephedrine, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
198	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
199	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
200	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
201	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
202	DDI-advise	It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
203	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
204	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
205	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
206	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
207	DDI-effect	Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the @DRUG$ are also additive to those of @DRUG$.

209	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
210	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
211	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and @DRUG$ and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
212	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
213	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
214	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic @DRUG$.
215	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
216	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
217	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and @DRUG$, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
218	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, @DRUG$, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
219	DDI-effect	It would be expected that @DRUG$ use during therapy with @DRUG$ would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.
220	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
221	DDI-effect	Phenytoin: Serum @DRUG$ levels may be increased by @DRUG$.
222	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.

227	DDI-effect	Non-selective MAO inhibitors including tranylcypromine sulfate, phenelzine sulfate, and pargyline HC1: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and non-selective @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
228	DDI-mechanism	In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the @DRUG$ was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
229	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
230	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
231	DDI-effect	There is thus an enhancement effect of @DRUG$ upon the reaction of placental vessels to @DRUG$ in vitro.
232	DDI-effect	"In the presence of @DRUG$ (10(-5) M), @DRUG$ (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;"
233	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
234	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, @DRUG$, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.
235	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."

242	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.
243	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
244	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
245	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, procaine, or @DRUG$.
246	DDI-advise	Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with @DRUG$ to extend the half-life of @DRUG$ is not recommended.

253	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or @DRUG$.
254	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
255	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
256	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
257	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
258	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.

263	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$ were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of morphine.
264	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
265	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
266	DDI-effect	Benazepril, like other @DRUG$, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
267	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
268	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
269	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
270	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
271	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, the effects of @DRUG$ on travelers receiving comedication, particularly diabetics or patients using @DRUG$, should be checked before departure.
272	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
273	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
274	DDI-mechanism	"A number of drugs, including @DRUG$, have been shown to displace @DRUG$ from plasma protein;"
275	DDI-advise	Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of @DRUG$, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
276	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
277	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
278	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
279	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
280	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
281	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with @DRUG$ and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
282	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
283	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with @DRUG$ or Norpace CR, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
284	DDI-effect	Levodopa and Amantadine: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with either levodopa or @DRUG$.
285	DDI-effect	Although glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce PROLEUKIN-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other @DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotension seen with @DRUG$.
286	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
287	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
288	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
289	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with acetaminophen overdosage or in those taking @DRUG$.
290	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or @DRUG$ in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
291	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
292	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
293	DDI-int	A possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of glyburide.
294	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
295	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
296	DDI-advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$.
297	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ with potent diuretics such as @DRUG$.
298	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$  causes a decrease in the steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration.
299	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
300	DDI-effect	Amantadine, tricyclic antidepressants, and @DRUG$ may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
301	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
302	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
303	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
304	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
305	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose @DRUG$ coadministration leads to higher @DRUG$ exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus.
306	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$).
307	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decrease the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
308	DDI-advise	The benefits and risks of using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed
309	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
310	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
311	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.
312	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$).
313	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
314	DDI-effect	Caffeine-related adverse effects have occurred in patients consuming @DRUG$ while on therapy with @DRUG$.
315	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
316	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
317	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
318	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
319	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
320	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
321	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients on @DRUG$ should be observed when @DRUG$ Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
322	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
323	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
324	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
325	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
326	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
327	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, @DRUG$, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
328	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
329	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
330	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
331	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
332	DDI-effect	CNS-Active Drugs Ethanol: @DRUG$ 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of @DRUG$ 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after ethanol administration.
333	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( phenytoin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$ ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
334	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
335	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with @DRUG$ overdosage or in those taking methotrexate.
336	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
337	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives.
338	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
339	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
340	DDI-mechanism	Acetaminophen: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen.
341	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
342	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
343	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, methotrexate, or @DRUG$ may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
344	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
345	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of @DRUG$, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone.
346	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
347	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
348	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
349	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
350	DDI-effect	If a @DRUG$ is also used, it may increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
351	DDI-effect	Hypotension, AV conduction disturbances, and left ventricular failure have been reported in some patients receiving @DRUG$ when an oral @DRUG$ was added to the treatment regimen.

354	DDI-effect	Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$ or enalaprilat.
355	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, @DRUG$, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
356	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
357	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
358	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
359	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
360	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines, or @DRUG$.
361	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
362	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, @DRUG$, metoclopramide, pimozide.
363	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
364	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
365	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
366	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
367	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
368	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
369	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
370	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
371	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
372	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
373	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
374	DDI-mechanism	Colestipol-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
375	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
376	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
377	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
378	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
379	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
380	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, @DRUG$, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
381	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
382	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
383	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
384	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
385	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
386	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
387	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
388	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
389	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
390	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: @DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125mg with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and Aprepitant when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
391	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
392	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.
393	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
394	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
395	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
396	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
397	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
398	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
399	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients taking @DRUG$, because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
400	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
401	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
402	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), @DRUG$ (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
403	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
404	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like @DRUG$ (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
405	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
406	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$.
407	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$) should be approached with caution.
408	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.

414	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
415	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
416	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with anticholinergic or @DRUG$.
417	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol) (with long-term, high-dose use) or

425	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
426	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to or withdrawn from treatment, dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required.
427	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used in patients receiving @DRUG$..
428	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
429	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
430	DDI-advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for @DRUG$ (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with @DRUG$ coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
431	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
