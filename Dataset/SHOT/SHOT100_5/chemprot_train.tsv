532	CPR:6	At 100 nM and higher, it suppressed the maximal response to phenylephrine. @CHEMICAL$ effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine even after inactivation of @GENE$ by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine.

579	CPR:5	The potency of the selective alpha 1D-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 against noradrenaline (pA2 = 6.16 +/- 0.13) and of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist RS-17053 against noradrenaline (pKB = 8.35 +/- 0.10) and against the selective @CHEMICAL$ agonist @GENE$ (pKB = 8.40 +/- 0.09) were too low to account for alpha 1D- and alpha 1A-adrenoceptor involvement. 4.

583	CPR:5	METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a @CHEMICAL$ receptor antagonist (SB-207266) on the @GENE$ mediated increase in plasma aldosterone (a 5-HT(4) mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects.

(+/-)-Tamsulosin effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of @CHEMICAL$ even after inactivation of @GENE$ by treatment with chlorethylclonidine, which is an indication that the (+/-)-tamsulosin-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to chlorethylclonidine.
