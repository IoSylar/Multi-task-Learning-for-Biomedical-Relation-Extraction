20	CPR:3	These findings suggest that @CHEMICAL$ activates the PI3K/@GENE$ signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of b-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.
21	CPR:6	These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and @CHEMICAL$ antagonist actions of @GENE$.

28	CPRFalse	To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in @CHEMICAL$-deficient cells, we found that upon @GENE$ exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2b-deficient cells.

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.

97	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ (10(-5) M), a selective @GENE$ antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor.
98	CPR:3	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of @CHEMICAL$ secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor @GENE$ (1 mM)."
