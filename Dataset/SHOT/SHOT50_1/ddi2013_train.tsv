120	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
121	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
122	DDI-effect	Non-selective MAO inhibitors including tranylcypromine sulfate, phenelzine sulfate, and pargyline HC1: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and non-selective @DRUG$ may cause hypertension.
123	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
124	DDI-effect	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin.
125	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
126	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
127	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
128	DDI-effect	Amantadine, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
129	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
130	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
131	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
132	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that @DRUG$, erythromycin, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
133	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
134	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
135	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
136	DDI-effect	Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed @DRUG$ preparations (minipills that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during @DRUG$ therapy.
137	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ depresses tubular secretion of certain weak acids such as @DRUG$.
138	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may occur when the two are used concurrently.
139	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
140	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
141	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
142	DDI-effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ but may be seen after several months.
143	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
144	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
145	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
146	DDI-advise	Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of @DRUG$ are to be administered with @DRUG$ because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
147	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
148	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
149	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
150	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
151	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
152	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
153	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
154	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
155	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on platelet aggregation, but did slightly enhance the inhibition of platelet aggregation by @DRUG$.
156	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
157	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
158	DDI-effect	Lamivudine: In vitro studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, U937 and Molt-4 cells revealed that @DRUG$ significantly inhibited @DRUG$ phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner.
159	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
160	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or inhalation general anesthetics.
161	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and @DRUG$.
162	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
163	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
164	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as halothane which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia..
165	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
166	DDI-advise	Anticoagulants: While studies have not shown @DRUG$ to interact with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, caution should be exercised, nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other @DRUG$.
167	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: @DRUG$, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
168	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
169	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
170	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
171	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as @DRUG$) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
172	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
173	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.
174	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
175	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
176	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ (equivalent to 145 mg TRICOR) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
177	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
178	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and @DRUG$ (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
179	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
180	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
181	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure of @DRUG$ (10 mg BID) was increased by 28% following administration of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID) for 12 days, while plasma exposure of valdecoxib (40 mg BID) was not substantially increased following administration of diazepam (10 mg BID) for 12 days.
182	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
183	DDI-advise	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because aspirin increases the rate of excretion of Nalfon, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
184	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
185	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
186	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
187	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal contraceptives Co-administration of @DRUG$ with an oral @DRUG$ has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG).
188	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
189	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
190	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
191	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
192	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
193	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
194	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
195	DDI-advise	If intravenous @DRUG$ is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with @DRUG$ should be interrupted.
196	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/@DRUG$ or zidovudine.
197	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
198	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
199	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
200	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
201	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
202	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
203	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
204	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
205	DDI-advise	Thus, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
206	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
207	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
208	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
209	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
210	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
