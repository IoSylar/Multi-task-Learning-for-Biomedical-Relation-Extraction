592	CPR:5	The involvement of EP1 and EP2 receptors is indicated by studies with the EP1 selective agonist 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, and the @CHEMICAL$ selective agonist butaprost (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists SC-51089 (EP1 specific) and @GENE$ (EP1 and EP2 specific).
593	CPR:5	As far as we are aware, the compound's @CHEMICAL$ scaffold represents a new core structure for @GENE$ agonists.
594	CPR:5	Dexamethasone (DEX), @CHEMICAL$ (BM), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either @GENE$.
595	CPR:5	The results suggested that both the EtOAc extract and @CHEMICAL$ were able to activate @GENE$, and Rhizoma Coptis contains potential natural agonists of PPARs besides berberine.
596	CPR:5	Discovery of novel cannabinoid receptor ligands by a virtual screening approach: further development of @CHEMICAL$ as @GENE$ agonists. 3D ligand-based virtual screening was employed to identify novel scaffolds for cannabinoid receptor ligand development.
597	CPR:5	Direct-acting @CHEMICAL$ agonists, including @GENE$, WIN 55,212 [R-(1)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate], AM2389 [9b-hydroxy-3-(1-hexyl-cyclobut-1-yl)-hexahydrocannabinol], and AM4054 [9b-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(1-adamantyl)-hexahydrocannabinol], produced dose-dependent increases in diuresis and decreases in colonic temperature, with slightly lower ED(50) values for diuresis than for hypothermia.
598	CPR:5	Direct-acting @CHEMICAL$ agonists, including D(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, WIN 55,212 [R-(1)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate], @GENE$ [9b-hydroxy-3-(1-hexyl-cyclobut-1-yl)-hexahydrocannabinol], and AM4054 [9b-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(1-adamantyl)-hexahydrocannabinol], produced dose-dependent increases in diuresis and decreases in colonic temperature, with slightly lower ED(50) values for diuresis than for hypothermia.
599	CPR:5	"Zolmitriptan (@CHEMICAL$; formerly 311C90) is a novel @GENE$ receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding aura."
