168	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
169	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
170	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
171	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.

178	DDI-effect	Anticholinergic agents: Although @DRUG$ is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used @DRUG$.
179	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
180	DDI-effect	- In isolated cases, a pronounced though reversible, impairment of renal function (accompanied by a corresponding increase in the serum creatinine level) has been reported in organ transplant patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy and concomitant @DRUG$.
181	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
182	DDI-effect	Vasoconstrictors: D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be used with @DRUG$ because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.

185	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with anticholinergic or @DRUG$.
186	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
187	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
188	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, thiothixene, @DRUG$).
189	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.

193	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
194	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
195	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

197	DDI-advise	If leprosy-associated inflammatory reactions develop in patients being treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is still advisable to continue treatment with both drugs.
198	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
199	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
200	DDI-advise	Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of @DRUG$, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
201	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (MAOIs).
202	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and @DRUG$) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
203	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
204	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., @DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
205	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as @DRUG$, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
206	DDI-mechanism	Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and @DRUG$.
207	DDI-effect	Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
208	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
209	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
210	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
211	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
212	DDI-effect	- Indomethacin: @DRUG$ blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the @DRUG$-induced increase in plasma renin activity.
213	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
214	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or @DRUG$, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
215	DDI-advise	Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral @DRUG$, should be used cautiously in patients receiving @DRUG$.
216	DDI-advise	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
217	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - @DRUG$ or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
218	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
219	DDI-advise	Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
220	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), @DRUG$, zileuton.
221	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of apomorphine in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
222	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, @DRUG$, and cimetidine.
223	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
224	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
225	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
226	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
227	DDI-effect	Exogenous @DRUG$ also appeared to influence the percentage of @DRUG$-induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner.
228	DDI-mechanism	"In a ten-subject study, coadministration of @DRUG$ (120 mg bid) with @DRUG$ resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;"
229	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the adverse effects of other @DRUG$ administered concomitantly.
230	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, warfarin, @DRUG$ or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
231	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and @DRUG$.
232	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
233	DDI-effect	Vecuronium: When used in the perioperative period, @DRUG$ has been implicated in the prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of @DRUG$.
234	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
235	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
236	DDI-effect	Although the magnitude of changes in diazepam plasma exposure when coadministered with @DRUG$ were not sufficient to warrant dosage adjustments, patients may experience enhanced sedative side effects caused by increased exposure of @DRUG$ under this circumstance.
237	DDI-effect	Imipramine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
238	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
239	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other @DRUG$.
240	DDI-effect	Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
241	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
242	DDI-effect	Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by @DRUG$ and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of @DRUG$.
243	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, co-administration of probenecid with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
244	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
245	DDI-effect	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
246	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
247	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, @DRUG$, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
248	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
249	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, @DRUG$, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
250	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
251	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
252	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
253	DDI-advise	Caution is advised in patients receiving concomitant high-dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy and coma have been rarely reported due to a possible drug interaction.
254	DDI-advise	Based on these data, @DRUG$ should not be used in patients on @DRUG$ therapy.
255	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
256	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
257	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
258	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
259	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace @DRUG$s, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.
260	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
261	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or inhalation general anesthetics.
262	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of @DRUG$.
263	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as troleandomycin and @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
264	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates and other @DRUG$
265	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of @DRUG$, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone.
266	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP.
267	DDI-mechanism	Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and @DRUG$, induce @DRUG$ metabolism, causing an approximately 30% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels.
268	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
269	DDI-advise	Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for @DRUG$ when coadministered with @DRUG$.
270	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients on @DRUG$ should be observed when @DRUG$ Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
271	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
272	DDI-effect	Ampicillin/Amoxicillin: An increase in the frequency of skin rash has been reported among patients receiving @DRUG$ or amoxicillin concurrently with @DRUG$ compared to patients who are not receiving both drugs.
273	DDI-effect	Selegiline - @DRUG$ and the selective MAO inhibitor @DRUG$ may have synergistic antidepressant activity if used concomitantly.
274	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
275	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
276	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
277	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and @DRUG$ (ACTH): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
278	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
279	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
280	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
281	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
282	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
283	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as @DRUG$ and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
284	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
285	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
286	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other @DRUG$, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
287	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.
288	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
289	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
290	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
291	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as @DRUG$ (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
292	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
293	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
294	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
295	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
296	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
297	DDI-int	A possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of glyburide.
298	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, @DRUG$, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
299	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
300	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
301	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and @DRUG$.
302	DDI-mechanism	In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of @DRUG$ given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg @DRUG$ increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.
303	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with HEXALEN and/or @DRUG$.1
304	DDI-effect	Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
305	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
306	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin, and @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
307	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with @DRUG$ (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
308	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
309	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by @DRUG$.
310	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
311	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
312	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
313	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, @DRUG$, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
314	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
315	DDI-effect	Antihypertensives: @DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
316	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
317	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., @DRUG$, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
318	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
319	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, @DRUG$ and interferon-alfa.
320	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
321	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
322	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace coumarin anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$, from their protein-binding sites.
323	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
324	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
325	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
326	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
327	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
328	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
329	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with @DRUG$
330	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
331	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, @DRUG$, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
332	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Elevated @DRUG$ levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
333	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
334	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
335	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
336	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants and the muscle relaxant effects of @DRUG$.
337	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
338	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, vaiproic acid, and sodium valproate.
339	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
340	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ binds both @DRUG$ and T3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones.
341	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: @DRUG$ have been reported to cause a significant decrease in @DRUG$ clearance.
342	DDI-mechanism	Human growth hormone - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome.
343	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either @DRUG$ or verapamil is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
344	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
345	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
346	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
347	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
348	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, @DRUG$, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
349	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other @DRUG$, the use of alcohol by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
350	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other members of the @DRUG$.
351	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
352	DDI-mechanism	Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of @DRUG$ followed by a single dose of @DRUG$, increased Gleevec oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p 0.05) decreased mean cmax and AUC(0-8).
353	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
354	DDI-effect	Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
355	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life.
356	DDI-effect	"Drugs that reportedly may increase oral @DRUG$ response, ie, increased prothrombin response, in man include:@DRUG$*;"
357	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of single, oral doses of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (10 mg and 800 mg, respectively), a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor produced a 34% increase in zaleplons maximal plasma concentrations and a 20% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
