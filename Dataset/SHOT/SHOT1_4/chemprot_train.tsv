0	CPR:9	Glycylsarcosine coadministration could inhibit the uptake of @CHEMICAL$ in PEPT2(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not @GENE$(-/-) mice.
1	CPRFalse	The influence of sex, ethnicity, and CYP2B6 genotype on @CHEMICAL$ metabolism as an index of hepatic @GENE$ activity in humans.
2	CPR:4	In the current study, we reveal the inhibitory effects of @CHEMICAL$ on the metabolism of dextromethorphan (DXM), a dual probe substrate of CYP2D and @GENE$, in rats.
3	CPR:6	Brain but not spinal NR2B receptor is responsible for the anti-allodynic effect of an @CHEMICAL$ subunit-selective antagonist @GENE$ in a rat chronic constriction injury model.
4	CPR:3	In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of pro-inflammatory @CHEMICAL$ and NF-kB activation induced by @GENE$ can be mediated by elevation of [Ca(2+)]i in HAPI microglial cells.
5	CPR:5	Antiarrhythmic effects of @CHEMICAL$, a novel @GENE$ agonist in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. (-)-Epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility.
