110	CPR:4	Particularly, the effects of @CHEMICAL$ used as a non selective @GENE$ inhibitor in experimental and clinical studies will be discussed.
111	CPRFalse	This suggests that plant @CHEMICAL$ represent a distinct group in the eukaryotic @GENE$ racemase family and can be clustered into monocot and dicot types.
112	CPRFalse	The functional response of reIL-4-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. ReIL-4 either increased the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducible @CHEMICAL$ synthase (iNOS), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and @GENE$ (TNF-alpha) on CXCL-8.
113	CPRFalse	@CHEMICAL$, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduces Na(+) influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with @GENE$: comparison with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.
114	CPRFalse	These results suggest that ATP-bound @CHEMICAL$ may be the specific target of @GENE$-sensitive TOP2 poisons.
115	CPRFalse	Pelargonidin activates the AhR and induces CYP1A1 in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines HepG2 and LS174T. We examined the effects of @CHEMICAL$ (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, pelargonidin) on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-@GENE$ signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells.
116	CPRFalse	These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of LVP and CRH on @CHEMICAL$ secretion: namely, @GENE$ and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.
117	CPRFalse	"On days 0 and 35, patients' nutritional status was assessed by BMI, normalized protein catabolic rate, predialytic creatinine, serum albumin and transthyretin; lipid metabolism by plasma LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, @CHEMICAL$, phospholipids, apo A-I, A-II, B, C-II, C-III, E and lipoprotein (a); oxidative status by alpha-tocopherol, retinol, selenium, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and advanced oxidized protein products; inflammatory status by serum C-reactive protein, @GENE$, IL-2 and IL-6."
118	CPRFalse	Using the mTOR inhibitor @CHEMICAL$ we found that TGFb-induced both early and sustained activation of TORC1 and TORC2 was necessary for @GENE$ suppression.
119	CPRFalse	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a (@CHEMICAL$) activation mimicked the effects of @GENE$ while PPARa inhibition prevented the effects of this SIRT1 activator.
120	CPR:9	In breast cancer, intratumoural @CHEMICAL$ is the source for local @GENE$ production in the tissue.
121	CPRFalse	An article presented in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology (p. 1527) provides an intriguing example of how @CHEM-GENE$ inhibitors can be put to many uses.
122	CPRFalse	One major route involves the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent activities of the @CHEM-GENE$ (GDC, EC 2.1.1.10) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1) with glycine (Gly) as one-carbon (1-C) source.
123	CPRFalse	Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM, that gliclazide can stimulate @CHEMICAL$ activity via a partially pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism, and that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB-sensitive @GENE$ influx.
124	CPRFalse	"The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists SB224289 (300 microg/kg; @CHEMICAL$), BRL15572 (300 microg/kg; 5-HT1D), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg; alpha2), SB224289 + BRL15572 (300 microg/kg each), SB224289 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), BRL15572 + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg each), rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg; alpha1), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), @GENE$ (300 microg/kg) + rauwolscine (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + BRL44408 (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2A), SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2B), or SB224289 (300 microg/kg) + prazosin (100 microg/kg) + MK912 (300 microg/kg; alpha2C)."
125	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of @CHEMICAL$, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither troglitazone nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. @GENE$ did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.
126	CPRFalse	Furthermore, OMT significantly reversed the up-regulation of @CHEMICAL$ and inhibited the calcium overload in the cultured neurons after challenging the @GENE$.
127	CPRFalse	These data demonstrate that loperamide differently modifies the stimulatory action of @CHEM-GENE$ and CRH on ACTH secretion: namely, LVP and loperamide act in an additive manner, while CRH and loperamide interact in a non additive way.
128	CPR:4	METHODS: @CHEMICAL$ inhibition was determined by measuring thromboxane B2 (TXB2)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg meloxicam and 75 mg @GENE$ and at steady state (15 mg meloxicam daily and 150 mg diclofenac daily).
129	CPRFalse	We show that cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT) is involved in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis, a regulated pathway that controls fatty acid homeostasis by promoting @CHEMICAL$ formation for fatty acid re-esterification during fasting. @GENE$ activity, as well as the incorporation of [(14)C]aspartate into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-F442A adipocytes was stimulated by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone.
130	CPRFalse	The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of histamine content, @CHEMICAL$ activity and HDC mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to toluene diisocyanate (@GENE$) and to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the above mentioned allergic parameters.
131	CPRFalse	"This study was aimed to compare the in vitro effects of 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(phenylseleno)oct-2-en-1-one (C21H2HOSe; organoselenium) and sodium selenate (inorganic Se) on adenosine deaminase (@CHEMICAL$) activity, cell viability, lipid peroxidation, scavenger of nitric oxide (@GENE$) and nonprotein thiols (NP-SH) content in the cerebral cortex slices of the young rats."
132	CPR:4	As opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, @CHEMICAL$ was hardly inhibited by @GENE$ concentrations up to 5 mM. In the absence of sodium, however, lithium can mediate succinate-dependent currents.
133	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither @CHEMICAL$ nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected PPARgamma. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an @GENE$ reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.
134	CPR:4	Dexamethasone (DXM) decreased the expression of CXCL-8, VEGF, and iNOS induced by reIL-4, while @CHEMICAL$ (1400W), a selective inhibitor of iNOS, decreased the expression of E-selectin, @GENE$, and iNOS.
135	CPR:3	The studies with dThyd rescue from @CHEMICAL$-cdk2 protein overexpression and growth inhibition by @GENE$ indicate that increased cyclin E-cdk2 protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of thymidylate synthase and resultant dNTP pool imbalance.
136	CPRFalse	Finally, the @CHEMICAL$(-/-) mice exhibited reduced brainstem gcg level and abolished b-cat @GENE$675 phosphorylation in brain neurons after insulin treatment. We suggest that Pak1 mediates the cross talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways on gut and brain gcg expression, and its ablation impairs glucose homeostasis.
137	CPRFalse	The high resolution NMR solution structure of the cTnC-cTnI-dfbp-o ternary complex showed that @CHEMICAL$ bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by cTnC and cTnI making critical interactions with residues such as Arg147 of cTnI. In the absence of cTnI, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of @GENE$. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.
138	CPRFalse	However, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (@CHEMICAL$ MAPK) and phospho-c-Jun @GENE$-terminal kinase (p-JNK) expression increased at 8-24 h. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities also increased at 8-48 h and 12-48 h, respectively, in the same manner as p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK expression.
139	CPRFalse	PURPOSE: To compare phenelzine (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits @CHEMICAL$ oxidase (MAO) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (@GENE$).
140	CPR:4	Glutaraldehyde crosslinked albumin nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the @CHEMICAL$ inhibitor @GENE$-L(x)-a platinum-bound sunitinib analogue-which couples the drug to methionine residues of albumin and is released in a reductive environment.

145	CPRFalse	Our experiments confirmed that the GDC/@CHEMICAL$ and C1-THF synthase/SHMT pathways normally operate independently in Arabidopsis plants but that when the primary GDC/SHMT pathway is impaired the alternative C1-@GENE$ synthase/SHMT pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of Ser.
146	CPRFalse	In all cases at both the 5-HT2A and @CHEMICAL$ receptors, the affinities of the isomers of MDMA and @GENE$ were at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than 5-HT.
147	CPRFalse	The role of drug metabolism in gemcitabine cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), 5'-nucleotidase, and @CHEMICAL$ deaminase, whereas the role of pemetrexed targets, thymidylate synthase (@GENE$), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) in drug chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies.
148	CPR:9	These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating @CHEMICAL$ activity or stability as a part of @GENE$ homeostasis.
149	CPRFalse	The 5-HT(1/2/5/7)-receptor antagonist methysergide and the @CHEMICAL$ antagonist LY 53857 enhanced @GENE$-induced hyperglycemia, while the 5-HT(1A/1B)-receptor antagonist (-)-propranolol and the 5-HT(3/4)-receptor antagonist tropisetron did not affect it.
150	CPR:4	Importantly, pre-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine (@CHEMICAL$), an inhibitor of @GENE$, prevented a-MeDA induced increase in GSH levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity.
151	CPRFalse	Phosphorylation of ER-stress marker eIF2a was also increased but only at 30 min of @CHEMICAL$ exposure. 2-Deoxyglucose increased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (@GENE$) on AMPK consensus sites but did not change the amount of TSC1 bound to TSC2.
152	CPR:4	PURPOSE: To compare @CHEMICAL$ (PLZ), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits monoamine oxidase (@GENE$) but also elevates rat brain levels of the amino acids ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA), with vigabatrin (VIG), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain GABA by inhibition of GABA transaminase (GABA-T), with regard to their actions on brain levels of GABA and ALA and on activities of MAO, GABA-T and ALA transaminase (ALA-T).
153	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of @GENE$ and the nuclear translocation of b-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by b-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells.
154	CPRFalse	During early pregnancy in sheep, the elongating conceptus secretes @CHEMICAL$ (IFNT) and the conceptus as well as endometrial epithelia produce prostaglandins (PG) via PG synthase 2 (PTGS2) and cortisol via @GENE$ (11-b) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1).
155	CPR:4	Inhibition of endogenous production of @CHEMICAL$ by PAG significantly suppressed SP concentration, @GENE$ expression and NK1-R expression in the acini.
156	CPRFalse	Inhibition of @CHEMICAL$ induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and the @GENE$ ionophore A23187.

171	CPRFalse	Change in affinity for cGMP, @CHEMICAL$, sildenafil, or IBMX in Y612F, H613A, L765A, or F786A was less, but affinity of H613A or @GENE$ for tadalafil was weakened 37- and 17-fold, respectively.
172	CPRFalse	PURPOSE: The fluoropyrimidine carbamate (@CHEMICAL$) is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inside target tissues. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking thymidylate synthase (TS) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (@GENE$).
173	CPRFalse	@CHEMICAL$ receptor induces bcl-x expression through @GENE$ favoring RNA polymerase II elongation.
174	CPRFalse	The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (@CHEMICAL$, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal @GENE$ and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells.

181	CPRFalse	Autoradiographs of PAGE-separated reactions containing either @CHEMICAL$-labeled factor IX or (125)I-labeled factor X showed that the increased factor X activation was not due to factor Xa-mediated feedback activation of factor IX and that there was increased cleavage of @GENE$ in the presence of factor IX in comparison with control reactions but only in the presence of both the enzyme and the surface.

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.
186	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ exhibited a significantly higher Vmax and Km values toward both HFC and UDP-@GENE$ than the other UGTs. 5.  Human, pig and rabbit, but not rat liver microsomes, catalyzed HFC glucuronidation at high rates. 6.

189	CPRFalse	This paper aims to review briefly the literature on the @CHEMICAL$ hypothesis of depression with a major focus on the possible role of @GENE$ in this disorder, while highlighting how recent data are more oriented on dimensional rather than nosological involvement of this structure in different conditions spanning from normality to pathology.
190	CPRFalse	In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the @CHEMICAL$-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the C2-ceramide-induced SRE activation selectively, implying a critical role of @GENE$ in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus.
191	CPRFalse	Although @CHEMICAL$ S-transferase omega 1 (@GENE$) and arsenic methyltransferase have been shown or thought to catalyze DMAs(V) reduction, their role in DMAs(V) reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain.

195	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ (PDTC), a specific NF-kB inhibitor, along with 20S proteasome inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced @GENE$ expression, which indirectly suggested that 5HHMF downregulated iNOS expression by suppressing NF-kB activity.
196	CPRFalse	"In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and @CHEMICAL$ administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by @GENE$ knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test."
197	CPRFalse	There is only partial overlap, however, between @CHEMICAL$-dependent deletion hotspots identified in highly transcribed DNA and those associated with rNMPs, suggesting the existence of both rNMP-dependent and @GENE$-independent events.

200	CPRFalse	"The @CHEMICAL$ contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) binding to interferon-stimulated responsive element (ISRE), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta); therefore, we investigated the effect of @GENE$ on the activation of these transcription factors."
201	CPR:9	Polyclonal antisera to either b5R or @CHEMICAL$ significantly inhibited @GENE$ (NHOH-4-ABP) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both NHOH-4-ABP and N-hydroxy-PhIP (NHOH-PhIP).

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native @GENE$, indicating that amino acids at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.
248	CPRFalse	The @CHEMICAL$/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the fewest @GENE$ bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous use in other cytokine receptor complexes.

285	CPRFalse	Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that @CHEMICAL$ inhibits the Kir6.2/SUR1 channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either Kir6.2/SUR2A or @GENE$/SUR2B channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM).

330	CPRFalse	The results showed that Pb(2+) increased [Ca(2+)](i) and decreased [Ca(2+)](ER) linearly in a time- and concentration-dependant manner, and Pb(2+) addition after the applying of a @CHEMICAL$ receptor (RyR) antagonist and an @GENE$ (IP(3)R) antagonist did not increase [Ca(2+)](i).
331	CPRFalse	Also, vinblastine enhances the phosphorylation of Ras homologous protein A, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, the release of intracellular @CHEMICAL$, as well as the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, p38, inhibitor of kappaBa (@GENE$) kinase, and inositol requiring enzyme 1a.
332	CPRFalse	The anti-hyperthermic effect of Lu AF21934 (5 mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and was not serotonin-dependent, as it persisted in serotonin-deficient mice and upon blockade of either @CHEMICAL$(1A) receptors by WAY100635, or @GENE$ receptors by ritanserin.

Increased sociability was observed 24 hours following the final oxytocin dose in BALB/cByJ, while prosocial effects of oxytocin emerged 1-2 weeks post-treatment in C58/J. Furthermore, acute @CHEM-GENE$ decreased motor stereotypy in C58/J and did not induce hypoactivity or anxiolytic-like effects in an open field test."
338	CPRFalse	By examining the relative effects of corticosterone (CORT), @CHEMICAL$ (AVT, the avian homologue to arginine vasopressin) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (@GENE$), the present study aimed to define the hormone profile regulating stress-induced increases in AA in the POM.

In the absence of @GENE$, docking localized dfbp-o to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of cTnC. The structural and functional data reveal that the levosimendan class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.

1207	CPRFalse	The action of 15d-PGJ2 does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) because troglitazone, a specific ligand of PPARgamma, was unable to inhibit iNOS induction, and neither @CHEMICAL$ nor 15d-PGJ2 could stimulate the activity of a PPAR-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected @GENE$. 15d-PGJ2 did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor NFkappaB, but it did inhibit the activity of an NFkappaB reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial iNOS by 15d-PGJ2 may involve interference with NFkappaB transcriptional activity in the nucleus.
1208	CPRFalse	N(5)-Substituted H(4)biopterin derivatives were not oxidized to products serving as substrates for @CHEMICAL$ and,depending on the substituent, were competitive inhibitors of phenylalanine hydroxylase: N(5)-methyl- and @GENE$ inhibited phenylalanine hydroxylase, whereas N(5)-formyl- and N(5)-acetyl H(4)biopterin had no effect.

1213	CPRFalse	The difficulties in reactivation of ChE activity and slight antidote effect regarding intoxication with some OPC are some of the reasons for continuous efforts to obtain new reactivators of ChE. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of some @CHEMICAL$ reactivators against OPC intoxication (tabun, paraoxon and @GENE$) in in vitro experiments and to compare their activity to that known for some currently used oximes (obidoxime, HI-6, 2-PAM).

1215	CPRFalse	A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the @CHEMICAL$ substrates and p-ABZ interactions with @GENE$ were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity).

CYP1A1 and @CHEMICAL$ mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of @GENE$ potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme.
1218	CPR:9	Even though the activities of @CHEMICAL$ and GNMT were elevated, the concentration of liver @GENE$ was decreased (24%, p<0.001) and S-adenosylhomocysteine increased (113%, p<0.001) in the dwarf mice.
1219	CPRFalse	Mutation of arginine 228 to lysine enhances the glucosyltransferase activity of bovine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I.

1224	CPRFalse	This stimulation was attenuated by the Pak inhibitor 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-dinaphthyldisulfide (@CHEMICAL$) or dominant-negative @GENE$.

[Trp(7)]GnRH-I and [Trp(8)]GnRH-I but not [His(5)]GnRH-I exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type gmGnRHR-2 than native GnRH-I, indicating that @GENE$ at positions 7 and 8 of GnRHs are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by type I and type II GnRHRs.
1229	CPRFalse	The modulating effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a ligand on haemodynamic effects of phenylepherine (PE), angiotensin II (AII), @CHEMICAL$ (ET1), acetylcholine (Ach), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and isoproterenol (@GENE$) were evaluated in glycerol-induced acute kidney injury in rats.

1239	CPRFalse	The functional response of reIL-4-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. ReIL-4 either increased the expression of CXCL-8, E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and inducible @CHEMICAL$ synthase (@GENE$), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on CXCL-8.

As such, @GENE$ possesses the first new therapeutic mechanism of action for a prescription insomnia medication in over three decades."
1246	CPRFalse	Computer modeling suggests that the KITD816V mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the KIT activation loop to which @CHEMICAL$ binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of @GENE$ by dasatinib.
1247	CPRFalse	Prostaglandin E1, E2, STA2 (a stable analogue of thromboxane A2), 17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2 (an @CHEMICAL$-selective agonist) and sulprostone (an EP3-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA Ca2+ current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit HVA Ca2+ channels was sulprostone>PGE2, @GENE$>STA2>>17-phenyl-trinor-PGE2.

Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular @GENE$ concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action.
1252	CPRFalse	PURPOSE: The fluoropyrimidine carbamate (capecitabine) is converted to @CHEMICAL$ (5-FU) by thymidine phosphorylase (TP) inside target tissues. 5-FU interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking @GENE$ (TS) but is inactivated by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD).

The structural and functional data reveal that the @GENE$ class of Ca(2+)-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of cTnC and stabilizing the pivotal cTnC-cTnI regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.

1608	CPR:4	"In support of the hypothesis that TCDD decreases canonical Wnt signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of TCDD on multiple components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of @CHEMICAL$ on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of @GENE$ (Rspo2 and Rspo3) that promote canonical Wnt signaling is reduced; (2) expression of Lef1, Tcf1, and Wif1, established canonical Wnt target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of Lgr5, a RSPO receptor that activates canonical Wnt signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of Dickkopfs (Dkks), inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling, is not increased by TCDD."
1609	CPR:4	Thus, the @CHEMICAL$-induced reduction in canonical Wnt signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (Rspo2 and @GENE$) rather than an increase in inhibitors (Dkk1 and Dkk2) of the pathway.

Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of @CHEMICAL$ secretion stimulated by @GENE$ was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (1 mM)."
1624	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ suppresses @GENE$ oligomer-induced microglia activation and thereby protects PC-12 cells from inflammation-mediated toxicity.
1625	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ reduced COX-2 expression accompanied by a decrease of bcl-2 protein, TNFalpha, @GENE$, GSH and an increased cytochrome c, but had no effect on that of COX-1, in MCF-7 and HL-60.

1635	CPR:4	"Blockade of PDE1 (8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100 microM), PDE2 [erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, 30 microM], PDE3 (milrinone, 10 microM; cGMP, 10 microM), @CHEMICAL$ (Ro 20-1724 [@GENE$], 100 microM), PDE5 and PDE6 (zaprinast, 30 microM), and PDE7 [BRL-50481 (5-nitro-2,N,N-trimethylbenzenesulfonamide), 10 microM] did not alter renal ecto-phosphodiesterase activity."

1646	CPR:4	Previous studies by this research team proved that vasodilating prostaglandins (@CHEMICAL$) E1, E2 and I2 inhibit @GENE$ (CA) in vitro and in vivo, which suggested involvement of CA in gastric acid secretion inhibition and the increase of gastric mucosa blood flow produced by this group of PGs.
1647	CPR:4	Local @CHEMICAL$ administration prevented the increase of airway @GENE$ and osteopontin and kept lung plasmacytoid dendritic cell counts close to baseline.

3891	CPR:5	The effects of the @CHEMICAL$ agonist @GENE$ on sodium taurocholate-induced experimental acute pancreatitis.
3892	CPR:3	Re-feeding normal chow or a high @CHEMICAL$ diet for 24 h after a 48-h fast increased both @GENE$ and ACS4 protein expression 1.5-2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies.
3893	CPR:6	The most potent compound, D,L-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5-(dipentylamino)-5-oxo-pen tanoic acid (lorglumide, @CHEMICAL$), has a great affinity for the pancreatic CCK receptors and is a competitive, specific and potent @GENE$ antagonist on the smooth muscles of the gall bladder and ileum of the guinea pig and on the CCK-induced amylase secretion of isolated pancreatic acini.
3894	CPR:6	In the rabbit pulmonary artery, @CHEMICAL$ and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the @GENE$, sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan.
3895	CPR:3	Activation of an apoptotic signal transduction pathway involved in the upregulation of calpain and @CHEMICAL$ in @GENE$-induced primary cultured cardiomyocytes.
3896	CPR:9	@CHEMICAL$ (H(2)S) is synthesized from L-cysteine via the action of @GENE$ (CSE) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS).
3897	CPR:9	Specificity of @CHEMICAL$: formation of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol and @GENE$.
3898	CPR:6	Inhibition of binding of the @CHEMICAL$ antagonist @GENE$ to recombinant alpha2-receptors by etomidate was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro.
3899	CPR:9	Glycylsarcosine coadministration could inhibit the uptake of @CHEMICAL$ in @GENE$(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not PEPT2(-/-) mice.
3900	CPR:9	The choroid plexus uptake of @CHEMICAL$ was studied in peptide transporter 2 (@GENE$) wild-type and null mice as a function of temperature, transport inhibitors, pH, and saturability.
3901	CPR:9	These results suggest that the altered gamma-glutamyl kinase results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on @CHEMICAL$ activity, which leads to an increase in @GENE$ production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
3902	CPR:6	Since the original discovery of @CHEMICAL$ analogs as PXR antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important PXR antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic @GENE$ antagonists.
