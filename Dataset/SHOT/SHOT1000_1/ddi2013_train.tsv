1210	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
1211	DDI-mechanism	Due to its nephrotoxicity, @DRUG$ may cause abnormal renal uptake to be seen on @DRUG$ bone scintigraphy.
1212	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.

1299	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
1300	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1301	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1302	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
1303	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
1304	DDI-mechanism	Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (etodolac capsules and tablets) results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin.
1305	DDI-mechanism	Sulindac: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.
1306	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
1307	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.

1312	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
1313	DDI-effect	In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg daily of @DRUG$ with the ACE inhibitor @DRUG$, 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks, was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to ACE inhibitor alone.
1314	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1315	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
1316	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking @DRUG$
1317	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1318	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.
1319	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.

1321	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
1322	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ are a major contributing factor to @DRUG$ toxicity.
1323	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
1324	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
1325	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
1326	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$, phenobarbital, phenytoin).

1328	DDI-effect	"In the presence of @DRUG$ (10(-5) M), @DRUG$ (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;"
1329	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.
1330	DDI-effect	We conclude that @DRUG$ prevents @DRUG$-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
1331	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1332	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1333	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for norethindrone and @DRUG$.
1334	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ inhibited the @DRUG$-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase due to release from the Ca(2+) store.
1335	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1336	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
1337	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, @DRUG$.
1338	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
1339	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
1340	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
1341	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"

1345	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
1346	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
1347	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1348	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
1349	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., @DRUG$), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1350	DDI-mechanism	However, in the second study, administration of 12 g @DRUG$ 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg @DRUG$ approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the cerivastatin AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
1351	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concurrently increases @DRUG$ anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.
1352	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1353	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$ (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
1354	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1355	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1356	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), @DRUG$ such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1357	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
1358	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
1359	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1360	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1361	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
1362	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: @DRUG$, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1363	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
1364	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
1365	DDI-effect	It is concluded that @DRUG$ is not a short-acting drug and that concomitant use with @DRUG$ would be expected to prolong further the duration of its action on the central nervous system.
1366	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of itraconazole and @DRUG$.
1367	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1368	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
1369	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
1370	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
1371	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
1372	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1373	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain @DRUG$ or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
1374	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
1375	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.

1377	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
1378	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1379	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
1380	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished binding of @DRUG$ by a net change of 9.9% (percentage increase in FDF, 21.2%) at 1732 micromol/L.
1381	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
1382	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
1383	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
1384	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., @DRUG$, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
1385	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.

1391	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone was found to have no effect on CAS, but can completely block @DRUG$-induced phosphorylation of this protein in MDA-MB-435 cells.
1392	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1393	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1394	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$ and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1395	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by @DRUG$, such as propranolol and metoprolol.
1396	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of @DRUG$ in both dietary cobalt treatments.
1397	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.

1401	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [@DRUG$] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
1402	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
1403	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
1404	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
1405	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.

1412	DDI-effect	Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients receiving @DRUG$ administered alone (at recommended dosages) or concomitantly with immunosuppressive drugs including @DRUG$.
1413	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine or @DRUG$ to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
1414	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, @DRUG$, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1415	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
1416	DDI-effect	Infusion requirements of NIMBEX in patients administered @DRUG$ prior to infusions of @DRUG$ were comparable to or slightly greater than when succinylcholine was not administered.
1417	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other @DRUG$, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1418	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1419	DDI-effect	Profound hypotensive episodes may occur when @DRUG$ infection and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly.
1420	DDI-effect	Haloperidol: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$.
1421	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1422	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1423	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and @DRUG$) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1424	DDI-effect	Diuretic: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$, produces a reduction in urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone.
1425	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
1426	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
1427	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$ chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
1428	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1429	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating @DRUG$ such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.
1430	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1431	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1432	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
1433	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
1434	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
1435	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
1436	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
1437	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant @DRUG$ use.
1438	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
1439	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: Reports indicate that @DRUG$ levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ for injection.
1440	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or @DRUG$, and iron-containing preparations.
1441	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of low-dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow.
1442	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., @DRUG$;"
1443	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
1444	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
1445	DDI-int	Medications can interfere with folate utilization, including: anticonvulsant medications (such as phenytoin, and primidone) metformin (sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes) sulfasalazine (used to control inflammation associated with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) triamterene (a diuretic) Methotrexate There has been concern about the interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1446	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the effects of @DRUG$.
1447	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and @DRUG$ resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
1448	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: @DRUG$ (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
1449	DDI-effect	Phenothiazines and @DRUG$ may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
1450	DDI-effect	Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when @DRUG$ was administered to rats treated with @DRUG$ 8 hours before the ethanol challenge.
1451	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
1452	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, @DRUG$, may decrease the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
1453	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), @DRUG$ such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1454	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, @DRUG$, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
1455	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
1456	DDI-effect	(Concurrent use with @DRUG$ may enhance the possibility of @DRUG$ toxicity associated with hypokalemia.)
1457	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
1458	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1459	DDI-effect	- Methotrexate (e.g., Mexate) Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the liver and/or the side effects of methotrexate
1460	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
1461	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving @DRUG$, procaine, or thiazolesulfone.
1462	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
1463	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1464	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
1465	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of HEXALEN and antidepressants of the MAO inhibitor class may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.@DRUG$, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased @DRUG$s half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
1466	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1467	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
1468	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1469	DDI-effect	Delayed Adverse Reactions to Iodinated Contrast Media: A review of the literature revealed that 12.6% (range 11-28%) of 501 patients treated with various @DRUG$ containing regimens who were subsequently administered @DRUG$ experienced acute, atypical adverse reactions.
1470	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and @DRUG$.
1471	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
1472	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1473	DDI-effect	Warfarin: Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were co-administered has been rarely reported.
1474	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1475	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
1476	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as @DRUG$ or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
1477	DDI-mechanism	Because Nalfon has not been shown to produce any additional effect beyond that obtained with aspirin alone and because @DRUG$ increases the rate of excretion of @DRUG$, the concomitant use of Nalfon and salicylates is not recommended.
1478	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
1479	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
1480	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
1481	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1482	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1483	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1484	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1485	DDI-effect	Endothelium-intact aortic rings from high-@DRUG$ rats were supersensitive to @DRUG$ when compared to vehicle-, progesterone- and progesterone + high-estradiol-treated rats (pD2 values = 7.77+/-0.12, 7.21+/-0.13, 6.93+/-0.04 and 7.22+/-0.18, respectively).
1486	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
1487	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
1488	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as @DRUG$, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
1489	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
1490	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
1491	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of delavirdine (20%) and @DRUG$ (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
1492	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
1493	DDI-mechanism	Extended Release Tablets: Administration of nifedipine with @DRUG$ increased @DRUG$ levels in 9 of 12 normal volunteers.
1494	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, antianxiety agents.
1495	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, @DRUG$, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1496	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as @DRUG$ and metoprolol.
1497	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1498	DDI-effect	In one controlled clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including @DRUG$, were reported to prolong the action of @DRUG$.
1499	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
1500	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, @DRUG$) should be considered.
1501	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1502	DDI-mechanism	Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of @DRUG$ followed by a single dose of @DRUG$, increased Gleevec oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p 0.05) decreased mean cmax and AUC(0-8).
1503	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
1504	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
1505	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1506	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, @DRUG$ or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1507	DDI-effect	Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including @DRUG$.
1508	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as ketoconazole and @DRUG$ should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
1509	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ along with either oral or intravenous @DRUG$ should be monitored for possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure and hypotension.
1510	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
1511	DDI-effect	Exogenous @DRUG$ also appeared to influence the percentage of @DRUG$-induced deaths in a dose-dependent manner.
1512	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
1513	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
1514	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a neutralizing agent for @DRUG$ that protects against renal damage.
1515	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, @DRUG$, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1516	DDI-advise	@DRUG$-containing therapies should not be used with @DRUG$ as they may diminish its pharmacologic action.
1517	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1518	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
1519	DDI-mechanism	Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.
1520	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
1521	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, @DRUG$ (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1522	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block @DRUG$-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
1523	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
1524	DDI-effect	Epidural @DRUG$ may prolong the duration of pharmacologic effects of epidural local @DRUG$, including both sensory and motor blockade.
1525	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1526	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
1527	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other @DRUG$ have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
1528	DDI-effect	Two of 16 subjects dosed simultaneously with @DRUG$ 10 mg and @DRUG$ 0.4 mg experienced a standing systolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg.
1529	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
1530	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1531	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
1532	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, @DRUG$, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1533	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, @DRUG$ and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
1534	DDI-effect	Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including @DRUG$.
1535	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
1536	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
1537	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
1538	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
1539	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
1540	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1541	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).
1542	DDI-effect	- Indomethacin: @DRUG$ blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the @DRUG$-induced increase in plasma renin activity.
1543	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1544	DDI-effect	In particular, convulsions have been reported when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ and special care should be taken when the treatment regimen includes both of these drugs.
1545	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and @DRUG$ (ACTH): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
1546	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
1547	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1548	DDI-effect	Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of @DRUG$ to treat strongyloidiasis during the @DRUG$ cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
1549	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, @DRUG$, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1550	DDI-effect	The effects of concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on the PR interval were less than additive.
1551	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, @DRUG$, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1552	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
1553	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with @DRUG$ may cause hypercalcemia.
1554	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), @DRUG$ and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1555	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1556	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
1557	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
1558	DDI-mechanism	Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when @DRUG$ was given with @DRUG$.
1559	DDI-effect	If a @DRUG$ is also used, it may increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
1560	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1561	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
1562	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other @DRUG$, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1563	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and @DRUG$-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
1564	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1565	DDI-mechanism	Ganciclovir: Administration of @DRUG$ 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral @DRUG$ was associated with a 111 (114)% increase in the steady-state AUC of didanosine (n = 12).
1566	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as @DRUG$ and erythromycin with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
1567	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, @DRUG$, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1568	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and @DRUG$-containing preparations.
1569	DDI-effect	When other @DRUG$ or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
1570	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin).
1571	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
1572	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
1573	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and tramadol (@DRUG$).
1574	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, barbiturates, and @DRUG$ may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
1575	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
1576	DDI-mechanism	Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 47% decrease in ethinyl estradiol and an 18% decrease in norethindrone plasma concentrations.
1577	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either @DRUG$ or verapamil is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
1578	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
1579	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the hypotension caused by the ganglionic-blocking effect of @DRUG$.
1580	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1581	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of @DRUG$ may be required or adenosine may not be effective.
1582	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
1583	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
1584	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other @DRUG$ and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1585	DDI-effect	Patients treated with @DRUG$ may be resistant to the effects of @DRUG$.
1586	DDI-effect	However, the antagonism of the @DRUG$-induced anxiogenic effects by @DRUG$ was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
1587	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1588	DDI-advise	This time window is different than for other oral formulations of @DRUG$, which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after @DRUG$.
1589	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ should be administered (with food) one hour after or more than two hours before @DRUG$.
1590	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
1591	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes (P = .005); this was prevented by @DRUG$ (P = .004)."
1592	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any gold medication, including @DRUG$ and Myochrysine.
1593	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
1594	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and Corticotropin (@DRUG$): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
1595	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of @DRUG$.
1596	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, @DRUG$, vitamin D.
1597	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
1598	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of @DRUG$.
1599	DDI-effect	- Antihypertensives: @DRUG$ may potentiate the effect of various @DRUG$, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.
1600	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [@DRUG$] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
1601	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1602	DDI-mechanism	The effect of TORADOL on plasma lithium has not been studied, but cases of increased @DRUG$ plasma levels during @DRUG$ therapy have been reported.
1603	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1604	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1605	DDI-mechanism	Based on total @DRUG$ concentrations, @DRUG$ increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
1606	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, @DRUG$, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
1607	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including nalidixic acid, may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1608	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1609	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1610	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), @DRUG$, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
1611	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ has been demonstrated to interfere with the elimination of other @DRUG$.
1612	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1613	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
1614	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
1615	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1616	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
1617	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, @DRUG$ and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
1618	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduced the blood AUC0-12 of @DRUG$ by approximately 20%, peak blood concentration (Cmax) by 16%, and 12-hour blood concentration (C12hr) by 26% in healthy subjects when tacrolimus (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart) was administered on the 10th day of CANCIDAS 70 mg daily, as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone.
1619	DDI-effect	Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: @DRUG$ can attenuate potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
1620	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1621	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
1622	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1623	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1624	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, @DRUG$, and some macrolide antibiotics.
1625	DDI-effect	Hypotension: Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on @DRUG$ and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$ or enalaprilat.
1626	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1627	DDI-advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their @DRUG$ dosage when @DRUG$ is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
1628	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, erythromycin, and @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
1629	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
1630	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: Quinolones, including @DRUG$, decrease the clearance of @DRUG$, the less active isomer of racemic warfarin.
1631	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of @DRUG$ and levodopa.
1632	DDI-effect	Chlorpromazine: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$ and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.
1633	DDI-effect	However, it has been established that @DRUG$ interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$ minipill preparations.
1634	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
1635	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1636	DDI-effect	Imidazoles (e. g., ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, etc.): in vitro and animal studies with the combination of amphotericin B and imidazoles suggest that @DRUG$ may induce fungal resistance to @DRUG$.
1637	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
1638	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), @DRUG$, zileuton.
1639	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ - @DRUG$ may potentiate the tardive dyskinesia side reactions of neuroleptic drugs if used concomitantly with them.
1640	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
1641	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1642	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1643	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1644	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1645	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
1646	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
1647	DDI-effect	@DRUG$-induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by vitamin E or @DRUG$.
1648	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
1649	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other @DRUG$ such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
1650	DDI-effect	Other @DRUG$ that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis have been shown to interfere with @DRUG$ in some studies and with potassium-sparing diuretics.
1651	DDI-effect	Injection of @DRUG$ 5 min before a nonlethal dose of @DRUG$ changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to endotoxin.
1652	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1653	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
1654	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, @DRUG$ and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1655	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
1656	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with etanercept alone (0%).

1726	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with @DRUG$ (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
1727	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
1728	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (@DRUG$, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
1729	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
1730	DDI-advise	Therefore when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ their dosage should be reduced.

1753	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ may increase the frequency and/or severity of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects.
1754	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of coumarin metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the @DRUG$ and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
1755	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
1756	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that ketoconazole or @DRUG$ co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
1757	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, @DRUG$(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

1761	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1762	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$ and magnesium hydroxide reduce the oral absorption of @DRUG$ by 75%.
1763	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.

1765	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, tacrolimus or digoxin has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
1766	DDI-advise	The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotensin can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
1767	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decrease the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
1768	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these @DRUG$.

1770	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels.
1771	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
1772	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
1773	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
1774	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1775	DDI-effect	The potential for increased sedation when @DRUG$ is given with other @DRUG$ should be appreciated.
1776	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ (40 mg BID (day 1) and 40 mg QD (days 2-7)) with @DRUG$ (10 mg glyburide BID) resulted in 21% increase in glyburide AUC0-12 and a 16% increase in glyburide Cmax leading to a 16% decrease in glucose AUC0-24.

1794	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: rifabutin
1795	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing @DRUG$, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
1796	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1797	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
1798	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.

1818	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants, most notably @DRUG$, and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is reduced by concomitant administration of N 2O.
1819	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
1820	DDI-effect	If a @DRUG$ is also used, the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity may be increased.
1821	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
1822	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
1823	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
1824	DDI-effect	Caffeine-related adverse effects have occurred in patients consuming @DRUG$ while on therapy with @DRUG$.

1831	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
1832	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
1833	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1834	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.

1846	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
1847	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, @DRUG$) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.

1855	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
1856	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
1857	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.

1864	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
1865	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or @DRUG$) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
1866	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
1867	DDI-effect	It was observed that @DRUG$ induced long lasting depletions of striatal dopamine concentrations and this neurotoxic effect could be prevented by @DRUG$ pretreatment.

1869	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
1870	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of @DRUG$ elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of Betaseron on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown.
1871	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
1872	DDI-mechanism	Indinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an 83% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 51% increase in indinavir plasma A.C.
1873	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.

1878	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1879	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, @DRUG$ and mecamylamine.
1880	DDI-effect	aBased on reports of narcotic withdrawal syndrome in patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, and evidence of decreased plasma concentrations of methadone.
1881	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, @DRUG$.
1882	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.

1901	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1902	DDI-mechanism	The absorption of oral @DRUG$ is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an antacid containing aluminum and @DRUG$.
1903	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other @DRUG$.
1904	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
1905	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
1906	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
1907	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and @DRUG$ may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.

2059	DDI-advise	Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and @DRUG$ has been observed, it is not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
2060	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
2061	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.

2076	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2077	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
2078	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, @DRUG$, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
2079	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.

2093	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC values by 14%.
2094	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
2095	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.

2104	DDI-effect	Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral @DRUG$ (an imidazole) and oral @DRUG$, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out.
2105	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.

2110	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
2111	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer @DRUG$ did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.
2112	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.

2137	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2138	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
2139	DDI-effect	Levodopa and Amantadine: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with either levodopa or @DRUG$.
2140	DDI-effect	Iodine or iodine excess may decrease the effect of Carbimazole, and an @DRUG$ deficiency can increase the effect of @DRUG$.

2143	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
2144	DDI-effect	In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone.
2145	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2146	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Because @DRUG$ can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including @DRUG$, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.
2147	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another.
2148	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with @DRUG$ and/or cisplatin.1
2149	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2150	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.

2152	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
2153	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
2154	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ritonavir, and @DRUG$) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2155	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine

2163	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
2164	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2165	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2166	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2167	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
2168	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, @DRUG$, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2169	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2170	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, @DRUG$, may decrease the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2171	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.

2179	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2180	DDI-effect	Pyrantel (e.g., Antiminth) - Taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ together may decrease the effects of piperazine.
2181	DDI-effect	Both the sedative and anticholinergic effects of the @DRUG$ are also additive to those of @DRUG$.
2182	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2183	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
2184	DDI-effect	"Drugs that have been reported to diminish oral @DRUG$ response, ie, decreased prothrom-bin time response, in man significantly include: @DRUG$;"
2185	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2186	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, @DRUG$, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2187	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2188	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
2189	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2190	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, co-administration of probenecid with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
2191	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: sertraline and @DRUG$.
2192	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
2193	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and @DRUG$) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2194	DDI-advise	Wait 2 weeks after stopping an @DRUG$ before starting @DRUG$.
2195	DDI-mechanism	Clofibric acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.

2197	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2198	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and @DRUG$, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
2199	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
2200	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2201	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
2202	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
2203	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
2204	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2205	DDI-effect	When combined with ofloxacin, KRM-1648 exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of @DRUG$ (or rifabutin) and @DRUG$.
2206	DDI-effect	Taking @DRUG$ after drinking @DRUG$ may worsen side effects and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.
2207	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
2208	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
2209	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2210	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
2211	DDI-effect	This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity when @DRUG$ is withdrawn.
2212	DDI-mechanism	or with multivitamins containing @DRUG$ may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue @DRUG$ concentrations.
2213	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
2214	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
2215	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2216	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
2217	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2218	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2219	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$s, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some @DRUG$ may result in severe hypertension.
2220	DDI-effect	When taken orally , imidazole compounds like @DRUG$ may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
2221	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ 1/35  increased the exposure of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by 20% and 34%, respectively.
2222	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
2223	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
2224	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol.
2225	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other @DRUG$, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2226	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with @DRUG$, including ibuprofen, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
2227	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2228	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2229	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
2230	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
2231	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
2232	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
2233	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and nitrite in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that @DRUG$ may react with @DRUG$ in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
2234	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
2235	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
2236	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that @DRUG$, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN.
2237	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2238	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, @DRUG$ and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2239	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2240	DDI-effect	For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
2241	DDI-effect	High-dose @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ protection.
2242	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;@DRUG$;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2243	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
2244	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2245	DDI-mechanism	In addition, other @DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of @DRUG$.
2246	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: Altered serum levels of @DRUG$ (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$.
2247	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: @DRUG$ and paroxetine.
2248	DDI-effect	Amiodarone or Verapamil: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased when either amiodarone or @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with a closely related member of the @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
2249	DDI-advise	Following the administration of @DRUG$, the dose of other @DRUG$ should be reduced.
2250	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
2251	DDI-effect	The risk of hypoglycemia secondary to this mechanism may be increased if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly in the presence of renal insufficiency.
2252	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
2253	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2254	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
2255	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, @DRUG$, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2256	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
2257	DDI-effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms (severe dry mouth, urinary retention, blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ is added to the drug regimen.
2258	DDI-effect	Co-administration of @DRUG$ at steady-state with a single dose of @DRUG$ (2 x 600 mg tablets) results in increased azithromycin serum concentrations.
2259	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
2260	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of anakinra (an @DRUG$) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2261	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
2262	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
2263	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
2264	DDI-effect	Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2265	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ in patients who are receiving @DRUG$ may potentiate renal disease states.
2266	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a neutralizing agent for @DRUG$ that protects against renal damage.
2267	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2268	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ are given to patients receiving @DRUG$, hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crises, may occur.
2269	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
2270	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
2271	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, @DRUG$ and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
2272	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as @DRUG$ which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia..
2273	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2274	DDI-mechanism	However, @DRUG$ anesthetic requirement (i.e., MAC) was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion as much as 56% 1-2 hours and as much as 14% 5-6 hours after injection of @DRUG$, 50 mg/kg, im.
2275	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145 mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (20 mg) once daily for 10 days resulted in approximately 17% decrease (range from 67% decrease to 44% increase) in atorvastatin AUC values in 22 healthy males.
2276	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
2277	DDI-effect	The response to @DRUG$ may be blunted by phenothiazines and @DRUG$ which cause a rise in prolactin.
2278	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may also decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, which can lead to a deficiency.
2279	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
2280	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
2281	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
2282	DDI-mechanism	Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.
2283	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and @DRUG$.
2284	DDI-effect	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2285	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
2286	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2287	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
2288	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral @DRUG$, warfarin, or its derivatives.
2289	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous @DRUG$ (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2290	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
2291	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, @DRUG$, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2292	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
2293	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2294	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2295	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
2296	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
2297	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, @DRUG$ or phenothiazines may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2298	DDI-effect	When a @DRUG$ is added to the therapy of a patient receiving @DRUG$, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed.
2299	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients taking @DRUG$, and renal function should be carefully monitored.
2300	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
2301	DDI-mechanism	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ (200 m m M i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17-28%.
2302	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
2303	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
2304	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2305	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, @DRUG$, or its derivatives.
2306	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant oral administration of @DRUG$ (a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral @DRUG$.
2307	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
2308	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
2309	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
2310	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2311	DDI-effect	Lithium carbonate: The stimulatory effects of @DRUG$ may be inhibited by @DRUG$.
2312	DDI-advise	All @DRUG$ should be used cautiously in patients taking @DRUG$.
2313	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
2314	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
2315	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2317	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
2318	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2319	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2320	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, @DRUG$, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2321	DDI-advise	Patients already stabilized on @DRUG$ should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with @DRUG$ coadministration.
2322	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2323	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2324	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem and @DRUG$ with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
2325	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of @DRUG$ and Penthrane (@DRUG$) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
2326	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if @DRUG$ and/or narcotics are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
2327	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
2328	DDI-effect	Patients receiving high doses of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites.
2329	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
2330	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
2331	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2332	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
2333	DDI-advise	Monitoring for amiodarone toxicity and serial measurement of @DRUG$ serum concentration during concomitant @DRUG$ therapy should be considered.
2334	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
2335	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing @DRUG$, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2336	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
2337	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when considering the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in patients with depressed myocardial function.
2338	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, @DRUG$, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone

2340	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
2341	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
2342	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and @DRUG$."
2343	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
2344	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
2345	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, Innovar Vet, or @DRUG$, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
2346	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating @DRUG$ such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol.
2347	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.
2348	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
2349	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
2350	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2351	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
2352	DDI-effect	Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue @DRUG$ after concurrent high-dose @DRUG$ therapy.
2353	DDI-effect	Interactions for Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Antihypertensive Therapy: @DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$ and vasoactive drugs resulting in postural hypotension.
2354	DDI-mechanism	High-dose @DRUG$ resulting in concentrations above 2000 ng/mL administered with oral @DRUG$ has led to an 80% increase in etoposide exposure with a 38% decrease in total body clearance of etoposide compared to etoposide alone.
2355	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
2356	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2357	DDI-effect	This allows @DRUG$ to open air passages, increasing the effectiveness of the @DRUG$.
2358	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.
2359	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may augment the activity of other @DRUG$.
2360	DDI-mechanism	In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between @DRUG$ (a benzodiazepine) and @DRUG$ under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product.
2361	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2362	DDI-effect	Other @DRUG$ (e.g. barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
2363	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
2364	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2365	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
2366	DDI-effect	There is thus an enhancement effect of @DRUG$ upon the reaction of placental vessels to @DRUG$ in vitro.
2367	DDI-mechanism	Leucovorin: The concentration of @DRUG$ is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by @DRUG$.
2368	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2369	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
2370	DDI-effect	H1 and H2 Blockers - Although not reported, @DRUG$, via its metabolism to histamine, might decrease the efficacy of H1 and @DRUG$.
2371	DDI-effect	Since bacteriostatic drugs, such as the @DRUG$ of antibiotics, may interfere with the bactericidal action of @DRUG$, it is not advisable to administer these drugs concomitantly.
2372	DDI-effect	Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics: @DRUG$ may enhance the blood-sugar-reducing effect of @DRUG$ and oral hypoglycemics.
2373	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of alcohol, @DRUG$, and other CNS depressants.
2374	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, procaine, or @DRUG$.
2375	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents: In some patients with compromised renal function who are being treated with @DRUG$, the co-administration of @DRUG$ may result in a further deterioration of renal function.
2376	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, @DRUG$, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2377	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;@DRUG$;and quinidine."
2378	DDI-effect	As with some other @DRUG$, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by NUROMAX is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving @DRUG$ or carbamazepine.
2379	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
2380	DDI-advise	- @DRUG$ or MAO-inhibitors (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2381	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents.
2382	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2383	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
2384	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;@DRUG$;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2385	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, @DRUG$, including sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
2386	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2387	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2388	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
2389	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with @DRUG$ (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.
2390	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
2391	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with @DRUG$ and lithium.
2392	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
2393	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
2394	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
2395	DDI-mechanism	When the @DRUG$ was administered 30 minutes after the @DRUG$ nasal spray, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and Cmax decreased 18%.
2396	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2397	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
2398	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2399	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, @DRUG$, or its derivatives.
2400	DDI-advise	If additional @DRUG$ are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated.
2401	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ decrease the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
2402	DDI-effect	Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats Epidural Injection @DRUG$ may potentiate the CNS-depressive effect of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2403	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
2404	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (@DRUG$, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2405	DDI-mechanism	These alterations in @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics produced by @DRUG$ explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
2406	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or @DRUG$-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2407	DDI-effect	Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral @DRUG$ (an imidazole) and oral @DRUG$, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out.
2408	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, @DRUG$, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2409	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2410	DDI-effect	The effects of nonbenzodiazepine agonists at benzodiazepine receptors, such as @DRUG$, triazolopyridazines and others, are also blocked by @DRUG$.
2411	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes @DRUG$, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2412	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either azithromycin or @DRUG$.
2413	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
2414	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2415	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2416	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other @DRUG$s, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
2417	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
2418	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, @DRUG$, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2419	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
2420	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.

2424	DDI-mechanism	MAO inhibitors MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of @DRUG$, slow @DRUG$ metabolism.
2425	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
2426	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, @DRUG$), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2427	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
2428	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
2429	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and @DRUG$ and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
2430	DDI-mechanism	Withdrawal of @DRUG$ decreased the @DRUG$ requirement by 50%.
2431	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, alcohol, and other CNS depressants.
2432	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2433	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, @DRUG$, and phenylbutazone.
2434	DDI-effect	- Antidiabetics, oral (diabetes medicine you take by mouth) Use of oral @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the blood and/or the side effects or oral antidiabetics
2435	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2436	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2437	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, @DRUG$ or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
2438	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, @DRUG$, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2439	DDI-effect	This allows @DRUG$ to open air passages, increasing the effectiveness of the @DRUG$.
2440	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as @DRUG$) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2441	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants with @DRUG$ preparations may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone.
2442	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, @DRUG$, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2443	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
2444	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
2445	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, @DRUG$, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2446	DDI-mechanism	The immediate release, but not the coat-core formulation of @DRUG$ increased plasma @DRUG$ concentrations by about 20%.
2447	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2448	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
2449	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
2450	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other @DRUG$) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2451	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2452	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
2453	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (another TNF -blocking agent) and @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2454	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as @DRUG$ (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2455	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
2456	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2457	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
2458	DDI-effect	It is not known whether this potentiation of @DRUG$ rashes is due to @DRUG$ or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
2459	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and @DRUG$.
2460	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2461	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ containing magnesium or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2462	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2463	DDI-effect	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
2464	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
2465	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, @DRUG$, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2466	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, alcohol, and other @DRUG$.
2467	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and aluminum-containing @DRUG$, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2468	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and @DRUG$.
2469	DDI-advise	It is, therefore, advisable to monitor @DRUG$ concentrations in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2470	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, @DRUG$, and lovastatin.
2471	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.
2472	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ formulations containing buffer should be administered at least one hour apart on an empty stomach.
2473	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease the effect of phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and ketoconazole.
2474	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
2475	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2476	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2477	DDI-mechanism	In eight HIV-infected patients, the steady-state AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 26% (95% CI = 14%, 37%) when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of @DRUG$.
2478	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, @DRUG$, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2479	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
2480	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
2481	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
2482	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, @DRUG$) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
2483	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, @DRUG$ salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
2484	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, quinine, quinidine and @DRUG$) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.
2485	DDI-effect	In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.
2486	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
2487	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
2488	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2489	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
2490	DDI-advise	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2491	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
2492	DDI-effect	"In monkeys, the effects of @DRUG$, but not (+)-NANM or PCP, were antagonized by @DRUG$;"
2493	DDI-effect	Ketamine: Marked hypertension and tachycardia have been reported in association with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2494	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
2495	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2496	DDI-mechanism	Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy @DRUG$ intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
2497	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
2498	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased @DRUG$ exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.
2499	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2500	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
2501	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
2502	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and @DRUG$.
2503	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2504	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
2505	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.
2506	DDI-effect	High-dose @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ protection.
2507	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: @DRUG$, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
2508	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
2509	DDI-effect	Co-administration: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with antiplatelet agents, @DRUG$, and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.
2510	DDI-mechanism	Acetaminophen: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen.
2511	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
2512	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
2513	DDI-effect	In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2514	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, warfarin, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
2515	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2516	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2517	DDI-effect	Adrenergic Agents:Some individuals receiving @DRUG$ may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, @DRUG$ or dopaminergic agents.
2518	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
2519	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
2520	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin(6), and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2521	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
2522	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2523	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
2524	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use with @DRUG$ or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
2525	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2526	DDI-advise	The IV @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
2527	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ diminishes the effect of @DRUG$ and warfarin.
2528	DDI-effect	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when @DRUG$ was administered with @DRUG$, the concomitant use of apomorphine with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2529	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
2530	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
2531	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
2532	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
2533	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2534	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by @DRUG$.
2535	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2536	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, @DRUG$, or thiazolesulfone.
2537	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased 62% when coadministered with fluconazole and 38% when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2538	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and @DRUG$.
2539	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as @DRUG$ (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2541	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
2542	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
2543	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2544	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2545	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.

2547	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2548	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, dexamethasone, @DRUG$) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2549	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (@DRUG$, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc).
2550	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2551	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: @DRUG$ increases the effect of @DRUG$
2552	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
2553	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with ENBREL  alone (0%).
2554	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another.
2555	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2556	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
2557	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2558	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was coadministered with phenytoin, @DRUG$, or H2antagonists, reduced plasma concentrations of itraconazole were reported.
2559	DDI-effect	Norepinephrine: @DRUG$ enhance the adrenergic effect of @DRUG$.

2570	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2571	DDI-effect	Although the magnitude of changes in diazepam plasma exposure when coadministered with @DRUG$ were not sufficient to warrant dosage adjustments, patients may experience enhanced sedative side effects caused by increased exposure of @DRUG$ under this circumstance.
2572	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2574	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
2575	DDI-effect	The administration of other @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been shown to reduce the antihypertensive effect in some patients and result in severe hyperkalemia in patients with impaired renal function.
2576	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
2577	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, @DRUG$, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2578	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
2579	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
2580	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
2581	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used cautiously in conjunction with @DRUG$ in hypoprothrombinemia.
2582	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2583	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

2587	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
2588	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
2589	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2590	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including @DRUG$.
2591	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
2592	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2593	DDI-mechanism	Mineral Oil-Concomitant intake of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may reduce the absorption of vitamin K.
2594	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2595	DDI-effect	- The action of @DRUG$ and insulin may be enhanced by Bezalip or @DRUG$.
2596	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2597	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when @DRUG$ or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2598	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
2599	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.
2600	DDI-effect	It has been reported that results of studies in animals indicate that @DRUG$-induced ventricular arrhythmias during anesthesia can be reversed by @DRUG$.
2601	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide and @DRUG$ reduce the oral absorption of @DRUG$ by 75%.
2602	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2603	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2604	DDI-effect	Selegiline - @DRUG$ and the selective MAO inhibitor @DRUG$ may have synergistic antidepressant activity if used concomitantly.
2605	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2606	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, @DRUG$), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2607	DDI-mechanism	Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: @DRUG$ may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby increasing their effect.
2608	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, @DRUG$.
2609	DDI-effect	Warfarin and @DRUG$: Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
2610	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced verografine and @DRUG$ excretion in chronic canine experiments.
2611	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2612	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2613	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
2614	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
2615	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Accutane and tetracyclines should be avoided because @DRUG$ use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of @DRUG$
2616	DDI-effect	Preliminary clinical data suggest that the incidence of nephrolithiasis is higher in patients receiving @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ than those receiving CRIXIVAN 800 mg q8h.
2617	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: May decrease @DRUG$ anti-inflammatory action by competing for the same receptors.
2618	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other @DRUG$, concomitant administration of Ponstel and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
2619	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (MAOIs).
2620	DDI-advise	Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2621	DDI-effect	Prior administration of @DRUG$ (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of @DRUG$ (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
2622	DDI-advise	The benefits and risks of using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed
2623	DDI-effect	Paclitaxel - In one report, @DRUG$ at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving @DRUG$, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
2624	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
2625	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other @DRUG$, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
2626	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
2627	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
2628	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
2629	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates and other sedatives
2630	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either @DRUG$ or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
2631	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in @DRUG$ levels with @DRUG$ co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
2632	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
2633	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2634	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may not be effective due to decreased @DRUG$ concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.
2635	DDI-mechanism	Ethosuximide: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$.
2636	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
2637	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with @DRUG$ and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
2638	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have been reported to increase steadystate plasma @DRUG$ levels.
2639	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
2640	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
2641	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2642	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2643	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
2644	DDI-mechanism	However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either @DRUG$ 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of theophylline (@DRUG$ , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.
2645	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2646	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2647	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and @DRUG$ (Ginkgo biloba).
2648	DDI-effect	There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of @DRUG$ that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
2649	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the adverse effects of other @DRUG$ administered concomitantly.
2650	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
2651	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2652	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), @DRUG$ (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2653	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, @DRUG$, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2654	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2655	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: @DRUG$, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2656	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
2657	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose @DRUG$ coadministration leads to higher @DRUG$ exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of sirolimus.
2658	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ usually depresses @DRUG$ activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
2659	DDI-mechanism	In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving @DRUG$ or digoxin in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
2660	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as @DRUG$, thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
2661	DDI-effect	Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
2662	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic drugs.
2663	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
2664	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, @DRUG$, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2665	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
2666	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2667	DDI-effect	1- adrenergic receptor antagonism, @DRUG$ has the potential to enhance the effect of certain @DRUG$.
2668	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2669	DDI-effect	Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to intravenous @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported.
2670	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone.
2671	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2672	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
2673	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
2674	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
2675	DDI-effect	In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of oral @DRUG$
2676	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of naloxone at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of beta-endorphin, and a high dose of @DRUG$ (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ (16 micrograms).
2677	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2678	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
2679	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2680	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
2681	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
2682	DDI-effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated.
2683	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2684	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
2685	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2686	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
2687	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2688	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral @DRUG$, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
2689	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2690	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2691	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and @DRUG$] is contraindicated.
2692	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when @DRUG$ and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
2693	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2694	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2695	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2696	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.
2697	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either @DRUG$, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or codeine.
2698	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2699	DDI-advise	For example, when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
2700	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to insulin or oral @DRUG$.
2701	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (@DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
2702	DDI-effect	Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2703	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (@DRUG$, thiothixene, alprazolam).
2704	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2705	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2706	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, @DRUG$ inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
2707	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactercidal effect of @DRUG$ and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
2708	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other @DRUG$ such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2709	DDI-effect	Two percent of patients treated concurrently with @DRUG$  and @DRUG$ developed neutropenia (ANC   1 x 109/L).
2710	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
2711	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
2712	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
2713	DDI-effect	Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were used in combination.
2714	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), @DRUG$ (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2715	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2716	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2717	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
2718	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.

2720	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a cytostatic agent, has been reported to inactivate the antifungal activity of @DRUG$ by competitive inhibition.
2721	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other @DRUG$ and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).
2722	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$.
2723	DDI-advise	Barbiturates and @DRUG$ should not be administered to patients receiving @DRUG$.
2724	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (@DRUG$) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2725	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with cimetidine (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of @DRUG$ (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.
2726	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2727	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of @DRUG$, phenytoin and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
2728	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
2729	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, @DRUG$, theophylline, vitamin D.
2730	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
2731	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
2732	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
2733	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and @DRUG$, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2734	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2735	DDI-advise	The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning although they do not bear directly on the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2736	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
2737	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
2738	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, @DRUG$ and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
2739	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2740	DDI-effect	Patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may need to be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time.
2741	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2742	DDI-effect	When taken orally , @DRUG$ like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
2743	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and @DRUG$.
2744	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
2745	DDI-mechanism	This increase is due to the inhibition of @DRUG$ metabolism via P450 2C9 by @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics: Metabolism).
2746	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
2747	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
2748	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), @DRUG$ (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2749	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
2750	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
2751	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, @DRUG$, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2752	DDI-effect	Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including @DRUG$.
2753	DDI-effect	Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2754	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and @DRUG$, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
2755	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: @DRUG$  is not recommended for use in patients who have received @DRUG$ within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics
2756	DDI-effect	Glyburide: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with the @DRUG$ glyburide has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.
2757	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ binding in vitro from 96.3 to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration.
2758	DDI-advise	Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully, and the dose of warfarin sodium or other coumarin-like drugs should be adjusted accordingly, in patients taking both drugs.
2759	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
2760	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2761	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2762	DDI-effect	When combined with @DRUG$, @DRUG$ exhibited strong synergistic activity while only additive effects were observed with the combination of rifampicin (or rifabutin) and ofloxacin.
2763	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2764	DDI-mechanism	The steady state plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and desipramine have been reported to be increased an average of 31% and 20%, respectively, by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets in doses up to 4 mg/day.
2765	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
2766	DDI-effect	Catecholamine-depleting drugs, e.g., @DRUG$, may have an additive effect when given with @DRUG$.
2767	DDI-effect	Serious toxicity may result if @DRUG$ is coadministered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$).
2768	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, @DRUG$, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
2769	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ with potent diuretics such as @DRUG$.
2770	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral @DRUG$ increased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%.
2771	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
2772	DDI-effect	There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2773	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (another TNF -blocking agent) and @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2774	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2775	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., @DRUG$), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2776	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2777	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
2778	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
2779	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2780	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
2781	DDI-effect	CNS-Active Drugs Ethanol: @DRUG$ 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of @DRUG$ 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after ethanol administration.
2782	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2783	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
2784	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine @DRUG$: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
2785	DDI-effect	1- adrenergic receptor antagonism, @DRUG$ has the potential to enhance the effect of certain @DRUG$.
2786	DDI-effect	Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes hypercalcemia.
2787	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
2788	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2789	DDI-effect	Although beta-adrenergic blockers or @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may be useful in combination to control atrial fibrillation, their additive effects on AV node conduction can result in advanced or complete heart block.
2790	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2791	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.

2794	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
2795	DDI-effect	Adrenergic blockers @DRUG$ are inhibited by @DRUG$.
2796	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular @DRUG$ and morphine.
2797	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients on @DRUG$ should be observed when @DRUG$ Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
2798	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
2799	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
2800	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2801	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking @DRUG$, methotrexate, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
2802	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ reduced @DRUG$ Cmax up to 50% after multiple dosing.
2803	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2804	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ stimulated, but did not significantly inhibit, proliferation in the presence of @DRUG$.
2805	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2806	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with @DRUG$ and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
2807	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has a tendency to antagonize the skeletal muscle relaxing effect of tubocurarine and may potentiate the action of @DRUG$.
2808	DDI-effect	The vasodilating effects of @DRUG$ may be additive with those of other @DRUG$.
2809	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
2810	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, @DRUG$, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2811	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2812	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
2813	DDI-effect	Exaggerated hypertensive responses have been reported from the combined use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including those contained in proprietary cold remedies and vasoconstrictive nasal drops.
2814	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
2815	DDI-effect	If desipramine hydrochloride is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/hypnotics, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of @DRUG$ and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or @DRUG$) are additive.
2816	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing @DRUG$ or aluminum with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2817	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational @DRUG$ such as halothane are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
2818	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2819	DDI-effect	In a Phase I trial using escalating doses of TAXOL (110-200 mg/m2) and cisplatin (50 or 75 mg/m2) given as sequential infusions, myelosuppression was more profound when @DRUG$ was given after @DRUG$ than with the alternate sequence (ie, TAXOL before cisplatin).
2820	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
2821	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and @DRUG$ may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2822	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
2823	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ inhibited the @DRUG$-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) increase due to release from the Ca(2+) store.
2824	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, @DRUG$, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2825	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$) should be approached with caution.
2826	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2827	DDI-effect	"These results suggest that the hepatoxicity of @DRUG$ in alcoholic beverages is enhanced by interaction with its congeners and @DRUG$;"
2828	DDI-mechanism	Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of @DRUG$ in anhydrous and aqueous @DRUG$ solutions.
2829	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2830	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as @DRUG$ and atorvastatin.
2831	DDI-effect	Since @DRUG$ and potassium-sparing diuretics, including @DRUG$, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.
2832	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2833	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ and partly antagonized the effect of morphine.
2834	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
2835	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of loperamide and partly antagonized the effect of @DRUG$.
2836	DDI-effect	Additionally, @DRUG$, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
2837	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
2838	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2839	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, @DRUG$, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2840	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ are given in conjunction with @DRUG$.
2841	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2842	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
2843	DDI-mechanism	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg @DRUG$ was coadministered with each dose of @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg/day) in eight neurocysticercosis patients.
2844	DDI-mechanism	In a single subject given one dose of @DRUG$ 2 hours after a dose of @DRUG$-placebo tablets, a greater than 50% reduction in the AUC of ciprofloxacin was observed.
2845	DDI-mechanism	Chronic administration of @DRUG$, a known enzyme inducer, may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of @DRUG$.
2846	DDI-mechanism	Another oral azole antifungal, @DRUG$, inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastermizole which may prolong QT intervals.
2847	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
2848	DDI-int	A possible drug interaction of @DRUG$ and intravenous @DRUG$ has been described.
2849	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ because of the possibility of ototoxicity.
2850	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
2851	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (@DRUG$, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2852	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
2853	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
2854	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2855	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2856	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2857	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
2858	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with @DRUG$, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2859	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2860	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
2861	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral @DRUG$, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2862	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ treatment should be closely monitored when @DRUG$ is introduced or withdrawn.
2863	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
2864	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$ tablets and other @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.
2865	DDI-effect	Psychoactive Drugs: Hallucinations have been reported when @DRUG$ was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, @DRUG$, alprazolam).
2866	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
2867	DDI-advise	Oral Anticoagulants CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN @DRUG$ ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH @DRUG$.
2868	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
2869	DDI-advise	If these agents are to be administered concurrently, @DRUG$ concentrations should be monitored, especially when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued.
2870	DDI-effect	In post-marketing experience, bleeding has been reported in patients on concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2871	DDI-effect	Lithium carbonate: The anorectic and stimulatory effects of @DRUG$ may be inhibited by @DRUG$.
2872	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in @DRUG$ therapy.
2873	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
2874	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
2875	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2876	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.
2877	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and @DRUG$) is contraindicated .
2878	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2879	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
2880	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
2881	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as @DRUG$, spironolactone, and cimetidine.
2882	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, @DRUG$, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2883	DDI-effect	Adrenergic blockers: @DRUG$ are inhibited by @DRUG$.
2884	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple-dose study, @DRUG$ caused a dose-related increase in the mean elimination half-life of @DRUG$, thereby decreasing the clearance of caffeine by up to 80% and leading to a five-fold increase in the AUC and the half-life of caffeine.
2885	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other members of the @DRUG$.
2886	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and Corticotropin (ACTH): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
2887	DDI-effect	the doses of @DRUG$ required to antagonize the effects of (-)-NANM were more than 100 times higher than those required to antagonize the effects of @DRUG$.
2888	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
2889	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
2890	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (@DRUG$ and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
2891	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
2892	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
2893	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), @DRUG$, zileuton.
2894	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2895	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or @DRUG$, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2896	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, @DRUG$, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2897	DDI-effect	Although this effect was noted even when @DRUG$ was given 4 hours prior to @DRUG$, this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy.
2898	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2899	DDI-advise	Careful observation is required when @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
2900	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2901	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
2902	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
2903	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedatives.
2904	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
2905	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
2906	DDI-advise	Considerable caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with Phenurone (@DRUG$) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
2907	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2908	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the @DRUG$ (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2909	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2910	DDI-effect	This may indicate that @DRUG$ could enhance the toxicity of @DRUG$.
2911	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
2912	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, @DRUG$, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2913	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
2914	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, @DRUG$ or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2915	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
2916	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and @DRUG$.
2917	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2918	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, @DRUG$, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2919	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
2920	DDI-effect	Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
2921	DDI-effect	The effects of concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on the PR interval were less than additive.
2922	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, @DRUG$, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2923	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
2924	DDI-effect	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that disulfiram may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
2925	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), @DRUG$ (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2926	DDI-advise	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made.
2927	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2928	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (@DRUG$, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2929	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2930	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing @DRUG$ or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2931	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.

2940	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2941	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ with drugs that are known to inhibit phosphatase activities (e.g., @DRUG$).
2942	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
2943	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.

2951	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
2952	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, @DRUG$, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2953	DDI-effect	Taking a @DRUG$ while you are taking or within 2 weeks of taking @DRUG$ may increase the risk of central nervous system depression or may cause a severe high blood pressure reaction.
2954	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
2955	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
2956	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
2957	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
2958	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2959	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2960	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have been reported to increase steadystate plasma @DRUG$ levels.
2961	DDI-advise	Because a similar interaction is likely, @DRUG$ should also not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
2962	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including @DRUG$) has additive depressant effects.

2967	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
2968	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and @DRUG$) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.

2972	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
2973	DDI-effect	In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2974	DDI-effect	only @DRUG$ enhances @DRUG$-induced increases in accumbal dopamine.
2975	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2976	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and @DRUG$) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
2977	DDI-advise	Based on the chemical resemblance of itraconazole and ketoconazole, coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
2978	DDI-effect	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and methotrexate and increase @DRUG$ s nephrotoxicity.
2979	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2980	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and @DRUG$ may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.

2984	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: In vitro and/or in vivo data show that clarithromycin, @DRUG$, and troleandomycin markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2985	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including @DRUG$ and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2986	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.

2990	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
2991	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
2992	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and @DRUG$ (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
2993	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2994	DDI-advise	Although a 3-day regimen of @DRUG$ given concomitantly with oral @DRUG$ has not been studied, alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be used.
2995	DDI-mechanism	Promethazine: Coadministration of a single dose of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (10 and 25 mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of zaleplon, but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
2996	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including @DRUG$ or its derivatives or similar agents.
2997	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2998	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, @DRUG$, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2999	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
3000	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of @DRUG$.
3001	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
3002	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases lithium renal clearance and increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3003	DDI-advise	Thus, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided.
3004	DDI-effect	Coingestion of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
3005	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$ therapy
3006	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including @DRUG$ and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
3007	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3008	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
3009	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3010	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of @DRUG$ metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the coumarin anticoagulants and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
3011	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (Depen, @DRUG$), another arthritis medication.
3012	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving cyclopropane or @DRUG$.
3013	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
3014	DDI-effect	This may indicate that @DRUG$ could enhance the toxicity of @DRUG$.
3015	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
3016	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ modifies @DRUG$ metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin.
3017	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3018	DDI-mechanism	Rifabutin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in a 32% decrease in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 207% increase in rifabutin plasma A.C.

3021	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse (@DRUG$, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
3022	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3023	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3024	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the effects of @DRUG$.
3025	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
3026	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Demonstrated to be CYP 3A Inhibitors of Possible Clinical Significance on the Basis of Clinical Studies Involving Alprazolam (caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam): Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 21%, increased half-life by 17%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.
3027	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ is taken concurrently with oral @DRUG$, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded.
3028	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3029	DDI-mechanism	Single doses of either @DRUG$ or colestipol resins bind the @DRUG$ and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
3030	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
3031	DDI-effect	Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by cyclophosphamide and other @DRUG$ has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of @DRUG$.
3032	DDI-advise	Experience with co-administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and Fentanyl in patients is limited,therefore,consideration should be given to temporarily suspending use of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3033	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of enalapril and @DRUG$ IV is augmented by @DRUG$ that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).
3034	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of @DRUG$ and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3035	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, @DRUG$, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3037	DDI-mechanism	The serum estrogen concentrations of @DRUG$ + @DRUG$-treated rats decreased by 50%, while those of the endotoxin-treated rats increased (2- to 5-fold).
3038	DDI-effect	Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals.
3039	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, @DRUG$, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3040	DDI-mechanism	There is a significant increase in exposure to imatinib when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$ (CYP3A4 inhibitor).
3041	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: In controlled studies in healthy volunteers, @DRUG$ either had no effect (one study) or was associated with modest increases, about 30% (two studies) in steady-state serum @DRUG$ concentrations.
3042	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3043	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as @DRUG$ (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3044	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
3045	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
3046	DDI-effect	therefore, the efficacy of oral @DRUG$ during administration of @DRUG$ may be reduced.
3047	DDI-mechanism	Clofibric acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3048	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;"
3049	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
3050	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
3051	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3052	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3053	DDI-advise	It is not known if the effects of @DRUG$ are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (@DRUG$, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed.

3080	DDI-advise	Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.
3081	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in @DRUG$metabolism.
3082	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, if @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in digoxin levels.
3083	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3087	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3088	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3089	DDI-mechanism	Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that @DRUG$ might increase the clearance of @DRUG$ should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.
3090	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that @DRUG$ clearance is 60% greater in patients taking @DRUG$ with or without other enzyme- inducing AEDs.

3099	DDI-effect	Fentanyl Anesthesia: Severe hypotension has been reported during @DRUG$ anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a @DRUG$.
3100	DDI-effect	The prior administration of @DRUG$ does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$.
3101	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3102	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3103	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including @DRUG$, tranquilizers, and alcohol.
3104	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
3105	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.

3116	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (@DRUG$).
3117	DDI-mechanism	After the coadministration of 200 mg oral @DRUG$ twice daily and one 20 mg dose of @DRUG$ to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (  142 S.D.) and 251% (  68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo.
3118	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
3119	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (5 mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized the inhibitory effect of loperamide and partly antagonized the effect of @DRUG$.
3120	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3121	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cimetidine, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied
3122	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
3123	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
3124	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline .

3126	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not beadministered concomitantly becausedecreases in nevirapine plasmaconcentrations may reduce the efficacy ofthe drug.
3127	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and @DRUG$) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3128	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3129	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
3130	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
3131	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
3132	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple dose study of @DRUG$ (400 mg once daily for 3 days) and @DRUG$ (20 mg once daily for 3 days), a 16% decrease in the clearance of cetirizine was observed.
3133	DDI-mechanism	Antacids or @DRUG$ substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
3134	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
3135	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).

3142	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
3143	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$.
3144	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
3145	DDI-effect	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of @DRUG$.
3146	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
3147	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
3148	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as @DRUG$ or tolbutamide from their binding sites.

3152	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
3153	DDI-effect	Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a @DRUG$.
3154	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
3155	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3156	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.

3161	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of @DRUG$ (vitamin C) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
3162	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to ACE inhibitors and @DRUG$ increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).
3163	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of @DRUG$ (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
3164	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of apomorphine in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
3165	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
3166	DDI-effect	Combined treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation.
3167	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3168	DDI-mechanism	INH (@DRUG$) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3169	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking diclofenac or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, methotrexate, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
3170	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
3171	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3172	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of @DRUG$ (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
3173	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3174	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (@DRUG$, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
3175	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
3176	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3177	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3178	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3179	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of @DRUG$, and a high dose of naloxone (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin (16 micrograms).
3180	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, @DRUG$, methyldopa and mecamylamine.
3181	DDI-effect	During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using @DRUG$ in association with @DRUG$, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.
3182	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other @DRUG$.
3183	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
3184	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (@DRUG$), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3185	DDI-advise	Patients receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.
3186	DDI-mechanism	This small decrease in excretion of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ is not expected to be of clinical importance.
3187	DDI-effect	In patients, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ was associated with a higher occurrence of torsade de pointes.
3188	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3189	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine
3190	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing @DRUG$ (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3191	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used together.
3192	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3193	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as @DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3194	DDI-effect	The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when @DRUG$ was administered on the same day as @DRUG$ than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients).
3195	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
3196	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of ascorbic acid (@DRUG$) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
3197	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3198	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3199	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, @DRUG$, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3200	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: @DRUG$ have been reported to cause a significant decrease in @DRUG$ clearance.
3201	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including @DRUG$, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
3202	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
3203	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ is a novel peripherally restricted opioid antagonist that may selectively prevent @DRUG$-induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia.
3204	DDI-mechanism	This antagonistic effect of @DRUG$ on @DRUG$ natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide.
3205	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
3206	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3207	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3208	DDI-mechanism	Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some @DRUG$) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
3209	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: DURAGESIC  is not recommended for use in patients who have received MAOI within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by @DRUG$ has been reported with @DRUG$
3210	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other @DRUG$, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
3211	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3212	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the neuron blockade produced by @DRUG$ resulting in decreased antihypertensive effect and requiring increased dosage of the latter.
3213	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
3214	DDI-advise	Considerable caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with @DRUG$ (phenacemide) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
3215	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
3216	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients who are receiving @DRUG$ or monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs may result in an additive pressor effect .
3217	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3218	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3219	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3220	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3221	DDI-effect	It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed.
3222	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
3223	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, @DRUG$, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3224	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, @DRUG$s, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3225	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an @DRUG$ (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
3226	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and morphine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the @DRUG$ (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.
3227	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3228	DDI-effect	Cholinesterase Inhibitors: @DRUG$ may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of @DRUG$, thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis.
3229	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ (10 mg) and @DRUG$ (800 mg) produced an 85% increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of zaleplon.
3230	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3231	DDI-effect	Increased hepatotoxicity of @DRUG$ by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ in the rat.
3232	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3233	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, @DRUG$
3234	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, @DRUG$) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
3235	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3236	DDI-effect	Additionally, @DRUG$, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
3237	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
3238	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3239	DDI-advise	Particular caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., @DRUG$ or pimozide).
3240	DDI-effect	ERGAMISOL  (@DRUG$) has been reported to produce ANTABUSE-like side effects when given concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3241	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, @DRUG$, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3242	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3243	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
3244	DDI-advise	In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of @DRUG$ should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3245	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
3246	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3247	DDI-mechanism	Ethosuximide: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$.
3248	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by @DRUG$ without preventing its hypotensive effect.
3249	DDI-effect	An encephalopathic syndrome (characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness and confusion, extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS) followed by irreversible brain damage has occurred in a few patients treated with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
3250	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3251	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
3252	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ could exaggerate the depression of AV nodal conduction observed with @DRUG$.
3253	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ during therapy with @DRUG$.
3254	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3255	DDI-mechanism	In addition, other @DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of @DRUG$.
3256	DDI-advise	Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing @DRUG$ therapy in patients receiving @DRUG$ or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.
3257	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$, increasing the metabolism of chlorpromazine.
3258	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
3259	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of R-warfarin and @DRUG$ (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3260	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
3261	DDI-effect	SINCE THE CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF THESE TWO DRUGS CAN LEAD TO PHENYTOIN INTOXICATION, PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING @DRUG$ TO A PATIENT ON @DRUG$ THERAPY, A BASELINE PHENYTOIN SERUM LEVEL SHOULD BE OBTAINED.
3262	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
3263	DDI-effect	"Concomitant treatment of four patients in the United Kingdom with @DRUG$ and intravenous @DRUG$ may have caused hypocalcemia;"
3264	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: @DRUG$, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3265	DDI-effect	Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$, including lisinopril.
3266	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3267	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and aminoglycosides or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., @DRUG$) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
3268	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3269	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
3270	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3271	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
3272	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3273	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in @DRUG$ serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to lithium alone.
3274	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing magnesium or @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
3275	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
3276	DDI-effect	Prior administration of @DRUG$ (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of @DRUG$ (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
3277	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3278	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered @DRUG$, such as dopamine.
3279	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients taking @DRUG$, because of the possibility of conduction disturbances.
3280	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., @DRUG$).
3281	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
3282	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
3283	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;@DRUG$;and quinidine."
3284	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
3285	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3286	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
3287	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
3288	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ administration to a digitalized, hypothyroid patient may increase the dose requirement of @DRUG$.
3289	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (@DRUG$) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3290	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of @DRUG$ or warfarin.
3291	DDI-effect	Organic nitrates - @DRUG$ supplements theoretically may potentiate the effects of organic @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
3292	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3293	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.

3322	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
3323	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
3324	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3325	DDI-advise	These @DRUG$ should be used in the myasthenic patient only where definitely indicated, and then careful adjustment should be made of adjunctive @DRUG$ dosage.

3429	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
3430	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, @DRUG$, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3431	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
3432	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of @DRUG$ to subjects receiving multiple doses of @DRUG$, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone.
3433	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3434	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).
3435	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with @DRUG$, Innovar Vet, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
3436	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased to approximately 3.6-fold of control and half-life increased to 1.7-fold of control.
3437	DDI-mechanism	The mean percentage increase in the @DRUG$ AUC after @DRUG$ administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).
3438	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
3439	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with @DRUG$ or Norpace CR, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3440	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, @DRUG$, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3441	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3442	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used in patients receiving @DRUG$..
3443	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with @DRUG$/aluminum-containing antacids.
3444	DDI-advise	Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of @DRUG$ while under treatment with SUBOXONE or @DRUG$.
3445	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.
3446	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
3447	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, @DRUG$, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3448	DDI-effect	Aminoglutethimide: @DRUG$ may diminish adrenal suppression by @DRUG$.
3449	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ may lower @DRUG$ plasma levels, possibly by competing for protein-binding sites.
3450	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3451	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3452	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, cimetidine, @DRUG$), though this has not been studied
3453	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
3454	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
3455	DDI-int	A possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has been reported, resulting in a potentiation of the hypoglycemic action of glyburide.
3456	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, @DRUG$, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3457	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic @DRUG$, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3458	DDI-mechanism	In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the @DRUG$ was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3459	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (@DRUG$, oxazepam, temazepam).
3460	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
3461	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3462	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of @DRUG$.
3463	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$, cautious titration is advised.
3464	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ clearance by up to 25%, and may produce AUCs   1500  M min in some patients.
3465	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3466	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3467	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ at an increased dose (1000 mg every 8 hours) was given with @DRUG$ (600 mg once daily), the indinavir AUC and Cmin were decreased on average by 33-46% and 39-57%, respectively, compared to when indinavir (800 mg every 8 hours) was given alone.
3468	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, @DRUG$) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3469	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine or @DRUG$) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
3470	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
3471	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is known to raise serum @DRUG$ levels.
3472	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
3473	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of @DRUG$ (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, prednisolone (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
3474	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3475	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3476	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
3477	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3478	DDI-int	A two-way interaction between the @DRUG$, phenytoin, and the @DRUG$s has been suggested.
3479	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3480	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when @DRUG$ is used with other @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic drugs.
3481	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$ salts and digoxin).
3482	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3483	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
3484	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been shown to increase the mean half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve.
3485	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.
3486	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
3487	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
3488	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
3489	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs.
3490	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or @DRUG$ (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3491	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, @DRUG$, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3492	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
3493	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3494	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic @DRUG$ abuse, reserpine
3495	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
3496	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, @DRUG$, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3497	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3498	DDI-advise	Therefore, when using doses of @DRUG$ greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of @DRUG$ may be required.
3499	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, @DRUG$, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3500	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, @DRUG$, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3501	DDI-mechanism	Interactions of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in absorption and retention.
3502	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, astemizole, or @DRUG$.
3503	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
3504	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: May decrease renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ resulting in increased blood levels and/or ampicillin toxicity.
3505	DDI-advise	Appropriate laboratory testing should be considered prior to initiating combination therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms of hyperlipidemia or elevated liver function tests occur during therapy.
3506	DDI-advise	However, interactions may be expected, and @DRUG$ should NOT be used in combination with other @DRUG$.
3507	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3508	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3509	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as @DRUG$, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
3510	DDI-advise	Concurrent therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3511	DDI-mechanism	Enhanced @DRUG$ clearance secondary to @DRUG$ therapy.
3512	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3513	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$s serum concentrations.
3514	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3515	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, nicotine, and @DRUG$ may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3516	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
3517	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, @DRUG$, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3518	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
3519	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3520	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, @DRUG$, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3521	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
3522	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3523	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3524	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
3525	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, @DRUG$ GI motility agents: cisapride
3526	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
3527	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3528	DDI-mechanism	Antidepressants: In vitro data indicate that @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3529	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with @DRUG$ (10 mg/kg/day) (n=7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n=12).
3530	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3531	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3532	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3533	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
3534	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3535	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, itraconazole;"
3536	DDI-mechanism	Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and Lodine  (@DRUG$ capsules and tablets) results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin.
3537	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3538	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
3539	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
3540	DDI-mechanism	Interactions of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in absorption and retention.
3541	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3542	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing @DRUG$ or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3543	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
3544	DDI-advise	SUBUTEX and @DRUG$ should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
3545	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
3546	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
3547	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3548	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.
3549	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3550	DDI-mechanism	"In a ten-subject study, coadministration of @DRUG$ (120 mg bid) with @DRUG$ resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;"
3551	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
3552	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ Injection and @DRUG$ in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.
3553	DDI-mechanism	The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related @DRUG$, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.
3554	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled.
3555	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor @DRUG$ (400 mg q.d. for 3 days) resulted in an approximately 60% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximal plasma concentrations of almotriptan.
3556	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
3557	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the @DRUG$ C max by 23% and ceftibuten AUC by 16%.
3558	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with anticholinergic or @DRUG$.
3559	DDI-mechanism	Milk, milk products, and @DRUG$-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of @DRUG$.
3560	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (@DRUG$), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3561	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
3562	DDI-mechanism	"Interactions for vitamin D analogues (Vitamin D2, Vitamin D3, Calcitriol, and Calcidiol): Cholestyramine: @DRUG$ has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3563	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, @DRUG$, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
3564	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
3565	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
3566	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3567	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
3568	DDI-mechanism	Antacid (Maalox ): @DRUG$ reduced the bioavailability of @DRUG$ (N=16) by about 20%.
3569	DDI-mechanism	1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10% 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high Trileptal doses In vivo, the plasma levels of @DRUG$ increased by up to 40%, when @DRUG$ was given at doses above 1200 mg/day.
3570	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
3571	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were administered concomitantly.
3572	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels (500 mcg single dose).
3573	DDI-mechanism	Metformin: In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, plasma metformin mean cmax and AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%.
3574	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., @DRUG$, other antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3575	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational anesthetics such as @DRUG$ are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3576	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and @DRUG$ may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3577	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine and @DRUG$ is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3578	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
3579	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
3580	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3581	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3582	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of delavirdine (20%) and @DRUG$ (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
3583	DDI-mechanism	Bismuth: @DRUG$, given concomitantly with @DRUG$ or 60 minutes following enoxacin administration, decreased enoxacin bioavailability by approximately 25%.
3584	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3585	DDI-mechanism	"Cyclosporine: Combination @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations;"
3586	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3587	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), @DRUG$.
3588	DDI-advise	Standard monitoring of methotrexate-related toxicity should be continued if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3589	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
3590	DDI-mechanism	The effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of ergotamine.
3591	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, @DRUG$ (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3592	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3593	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3594	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, @DRUG$ for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
3595	DDI-advise	therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3596	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
3597	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may interact with the @DRUG$ preparation causing a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the idoxuridine preparation causing a toxic effect in the eye.
3598	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
3599	DDI-advise	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3600	DDI-mechanism	At higher than recommended doses, @DRUG$ 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving @DRUG$ 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
3601	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, @DRUG$, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3602	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC values by 14%.
3603	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
3604	DDI-mechanism	Even when an @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$-type drug are administered separately by different routes, a reduction in aminoglycoside serum half-life or serum levels has been reported in patients with impaired renal function and in some patients with normal renal function.
3605	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
3606	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3607	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
3608	DDI-mechanism	Ganciclovir: Administration of @DRUG$ 2 hours prior to or concurrent with oral @DRUG$ was associated with a 111 (114)% increase in the steady-state AUC of didanosine (n = 12).
3609	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: As with some other quinolones, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life.
3610	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including @DRUG$, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3611	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an 82% decrease in nelfinavir plasma A.C.
3612	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.
3613	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3614	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3615	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3616	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
3617	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., @DRUG$), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3618	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3619	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, @DRUG$, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3620	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3621	DDI-advise	"Patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored;"
3622	DDI-mechanism	Metoclopramide: Bioavailability is mildly reduced (approximately 10%) when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3623	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3624	DDI-advise	It is recommended to avoid concurrent administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ containing antacids for at least 4 hours following ethambutol administration.
3625	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3626	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3627	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3628	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
3629	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3630	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
3631	DDI-mechanism	In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma @DRUG$ levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.
3632	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, @DRUG$, trazodone
3633	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
3634	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
3635	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3636	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, phenytoin, or @DRUG$ increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3637	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3638	DDI-advise	In the case that you are taking @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, higher doses of digoxin may be needed.
3639	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3640	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3641	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, @DRUG$, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3642	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3643	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3644	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3645	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
3646	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3647	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (@DRUG$), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3648	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain @DRUG$, etc.).
3649	DDI-mechanism	Trough plasma enoxacin levels were also 20% higher when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were administered concomitantly.
3650	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
3651	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
3652	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3653	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, @DRUG$, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3654	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3655	DDI-mechanism	Diltiazem: In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of @DRUG$ once daily, as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation, with @DRUG$ 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2-fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of diltiazem AUC.
3656	DDI-advise	Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of @DRUG$ should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$ 400 mg daily.
3657	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, @DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3658	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of @DRUG$ and ranitidine is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3659	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider @DRUG$ that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3660	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other @DRUG$ cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
3661	DDI-mechanism	Saquinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with @DRUG$ resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
3662	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with succinylcholine or with other @DRUG$.
3663	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
3664	DDI-mechanism	HIV Protease Inhibitors: @DRUG$ (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life.
3665	DDI-mechanism	However, patients on @DRUG$ may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
3666	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, @DRUG$, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3667	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, @DRUG$, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3668	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
3669	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
3670	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
3671	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
3672	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3673	DDI-mechanism	"Oral contraceptives: @DRUG$, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of @DRUG$ and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43%, and decreased the AUC of norethindrone by 8%;"
3674	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (@DRUG$, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3675	DDI-mechanism	The coadministration of @DRUG$ decreases the biologic half-life of @DRUG$ because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine.
3676	DDI-mechanism	In the first study, concomitant administration of 0.2 mg @DRUG$ and 12 g @DRUG$ resulted in decreases of more than 22% for AUC and 40% for Cmax when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
3677	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3678	DDI-mechanism	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$.
3679	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3680	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., @DRUG$, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3681	DDI-mechanism	Patients taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of disopyramide resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
3682	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, @DRUG$ (AVONEX  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
3683	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, @DRUG$, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3684	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3685	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3686	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
3687	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of mercaptopurine and @DRUG$ to 6-thiouric acid.
3688	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold.
3689	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, @DRUG$, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3690	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of @DRUG$ in serum.
3691	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ produced a 25% increase in AUC and a 33% increase in the Cmax of acamprosate.
3692	DDI-mechanism	Alkalinizing agents: Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (@DRUG$, etc.) increase absorption of @DRUG$.
3693	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3694	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
3695	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3696	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines @DRUG$, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3697	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
3698	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3699	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
3700	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (Ultram).
3701	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, caffeine, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
3702	DDI-mechanism	Studies in humans show that the absorption of @DRUG$ as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before @DRUG$.
3703	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
3704	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3705	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, @DRUG$, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3706	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3707	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3708	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
3709	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3710	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3711	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
3712	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
3713	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, @DRUG$, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
3714	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3715	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), @DRUG$, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3716	DDI-mechanism	In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma @DRUG$ levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.
3717	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3718	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
3719	DDI-int	Chloral hydrate and @DRUG$ interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3720	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of @DRUG$ with 500-mg of @DRUG$ increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.  A number of compounds are inhibitors of CYP2C9 including fluconazole, lovastatin and trimethoprim.
3721	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3722	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as @DRUG$ or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3723	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3724	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as phenytoin or @DRUG$ from their binding sites.
3725	DDI-mechanism	Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of @DRUG$ in anhydrous and aqueous @DRUG$ solutions.
3726	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
3727	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
3728	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
3729	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3730	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3731	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, @DRUG$, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3732	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, @DRUG$, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3733	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3734	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered until a patient has recovered from @DRUG$-induced neuromuscular block.
3735	DDI-advise	Patients should be warned of the potential danger of the intravenous self-administration of @DRUG$ while under treatment with @DRUG$ or SUBUTEX.
3736	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given @DRUG$.
3737	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3738	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"
3739	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
3740	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3741	DDI-mechanism	In EM individuals treated with @DRUG$ or fluoxetine, the AUC of @DRUG$ is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.
3742	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3743	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, @DRUG$, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3744	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
3745	DDI-mechanism	However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of @DRUG$ nasal spray.
3746	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because naproxen is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3747	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, @DRUG$, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
3748	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
3749	DDI-mechanism	By decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption of primidone, @DRUG$ may decrease serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and its metabolites, with a consequent possible decrease in anticonvulsant effect.
3750	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3751	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3752	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
3753	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$  causes a decrease in the steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration.
3754	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, @DRUG$, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3755	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3756	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, @DRUG$, tolbutamide, trazodone
3757	DDI-mechanism	These alterations in @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics produced by @DRUG$ explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
3758	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3759	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, @DRUG$, and nifedipine.
3760	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate @DRUG$ Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
3761	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as ketoconazole, @DRUG$, and cimetidine.
3762	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
3763	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: @DRUG$ Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3764	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
3765	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, @DRUG$, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3766	DDI-advise	On administration of oral @DRUG$, the need for @DRUG$ therapy should be reviewed and the dose reduced by approximately 50% or discontinued.
3767	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
3768	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has led to elevated plasma concentrations of terfenadine, resulting in rare instances of life- threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and one death.
3769	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3770	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
3771	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, @DRUG$ resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3772	DDI-mechanism	The effects of ERGOMAR may be potentiated by @DRUG$ which inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3773	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
3774	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
3775	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (@DRUG$), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3776	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, @DRUG$, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
3777	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, @DRUG$, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3778	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3779	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3780	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
3781	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
3782	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (@DRUG$), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3783	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
3784	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, @DRUG$, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3785	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (@DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3786	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3787	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.

3789	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, @DRUG$, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3790	DDI-mechanism	A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and AUC (53%) after a 1-week course of @DRUG$ 1200 mg/day and a single dose of @DRUG$ 60mg.
3791	DDI-mechanism	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The administration of @DRUG$ to normal volunteers receiving @DRUG$ decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
3792	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ renal clearance and increases lithium plasma levels.
3793	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or @DRUG$) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
3794	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
3795	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ 30 mg and @DRUG$, a CYP2C19 substrate, resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of diazepam.
3796	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with 40 mg @DRUG$ tablets in epileptic patients lowered the nisoldipine plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3797	DDI-mechanism	The serum estrogen concentrations of @DRUG$ + @DRUG$-treated rats decreased by 50%, while those of the endotoxin-treated rats increased (2- to 5-fold).
3798	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3799	DDI-mechanism	In patients given very high doses (3900 mg) of @DRUG$ daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when @DRUG$, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.
3800	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
3801	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous @DRUG$, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3802	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
3803	DDI-mechanism	Resins: Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take @DRUG$ at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption.
3804	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
3805	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3806	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: After introduction of @DRUG$ (oral form), a sudden increase in serum @DRUG$ level has been reported.
3807	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (@DRUG$, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3808	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
3809	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, @DRUG$ Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3810	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: After introduction of @DRUG$ (oral form), a sudden increase in serum @DRUG$ level has been reported.
3811	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3812	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3813	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
3814	DDI-advise	- When Bezalip or @DRUG$ is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3815	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: @DRUG$ may raise serum @DRUG$ levels in some individuals.
3816	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3817	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3818	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3819	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3820	DDI-mechanism	Plasma levels of @DRUG$ may become subtherapeutic during @DRUG$ therapy.
3821	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
3822	DDI-advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their @DRUG$ dosage when @DRUG$ is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
3823	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
3824	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
3825	DDI-advise	It is suggested that in patients receiving @DRUG$, alternatives to @DRUG$ should be used if anticonvulsant therapy is needed.
3826	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3829	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
3830	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with Bezalip or @DRUG$ retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
3831	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3832	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (@DRUG$), and voriconazole .
3833	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
3834	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, @DRUG$, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3835	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3836	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3837	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3838	DDI-advise	Methotrexate: Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3839	DDI-advise	If leprosy-associated inflammatory reactions develop in patients being treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is still advisable to continue treatment with both drugs.
3840	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
3841	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3842	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, @DRUG$, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3843	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3844	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3845	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3846	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3847	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3848	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the @DRUG$ [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3849	DDI-advise	Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral @DRUG$, should be used cautiously in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3850	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, @DRUG$, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.

3856	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, @DRUG$, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3857	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3858	DDI-advise	Patients who have been treated with @DRUG$ within two to three weeks prior to the administration of @DRUG$ should receive initial doses of dopamine HCl no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
3859	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of rifabutin to half the standard dose and a dose increase of CRIXIVAN to 1000 mg (three 333-mg capsules) every 8 hours are recommended when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3860	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3861	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3862	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, @DRUG$, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3863	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
3864	DDI-advise	Patients using CYP3A4 metabolized @DRUG$ should have cholesterol levels monitored after @DRUG$ is initiated to see whether the statin dose needs adjustment.
3865	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combined use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should generally be avoided.
3866	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3867	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3868	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with @DRUG$.
3869	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3870	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.

3875	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3876	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3877	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3878	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral @DRUG$ are given.
3879	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3880	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ should receive 70 mg of @DRUG$ daily.
3881	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, @DRUG$ or warfarin.
3882	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
3883	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
3884	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3885	DDI-advise	Therefore, the concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated, and alternative hypoglycemic agents should be considered.
3886	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3887	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ Antimycobacterial agents: @DRUG$
3888	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3889	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, @DRUG$, nalbuphine, butorphanol, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.

3891	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with anion-exchange resins (e.g. @DRUG$), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
3892	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3893	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3894	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3895	DDI-advise	Wait 5 weeks after stopping @DRUG$ before starting a @DRUG$.

3995	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3996	DDI-advise	Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics.
3997	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
3998	DDI-advise	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine, it is recommended that @DRUG$ levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing @DRUG$ to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
3999	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
4000	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
4001	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
4002	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
4003	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
4004	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
4005	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., @DRUG$, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.

4014	DDI-advise	Nicardipine HCl usually does not alter the plasma levels of digoxin, however, serum @DRUG$ levels should be evaluated after concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ is initiated.
4015	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4016	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
4017	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or @DRUG$, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.

4019	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and @DRUG$).
4020	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral @DRUG$ are given.
4021	DDI-int	Medications can interfere with folate utilization, including: anticonvulsant medications (such as phenytoin, and primidone) metformin (sometimes prescribed to control blood sugar in type 2 diabetes) sulfasalazine (used to control inflammation associated with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) triamterene (a diuretic) Methotrexate There has been concern about the interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.

4023	DDI-advise	In patients receiving @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ concomitantly, any reduction in steroid dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden steroid withdrawal.
4024	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
4025	DDI-int	Drug Interactions: @DRUG$ may interact with some drugs, like @DRUG$ (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: Flupenthixol and Ethanol cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
4026	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
4027	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
4028	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption .
4029	DDI-int	conversely, @DRUG$ may interfere with antihypertensive drugs (i.e., @DRUG$, a-methyldopa).
4030	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
4031	DDI-advise	Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, @DRUG$ should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after @DRUG$ administration.
4032	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4033	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken within 2 hours of @DRUG$.

4036	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, @DRUG$, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4037	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
4038	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
4039	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.

4046	DDI-advise	Accordingly, when @DRUG$ is administered with oral @DRUG$, the prothrombin time should be closely monitored during and for several days after concomitant drug administration.
4047	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
4048	DDI-int	The in vitro interaction between @DRUG$ and the antithrombotic agent @DRUG$ is complex.

4054	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., @DRUG$), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
4055	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
4056	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, @DRUG$ and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
4057	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
4058	DDI-advise	@DRUG$- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
4059	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
4060	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (@DRUG$, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

4073	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
4074	DDI-advise	Although this interaction has not been reported with cinoxacin, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ is given concomitantly with @DRUG$-containing products.
4075	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4076	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other @DRUG$ (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
4077	DDI-int	Thus, the interaction observed between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not expected for dirithromycin.
4078	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.

4133	DDI-advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for @DRUG$ (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with @DRUG$ coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
4134	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
4135	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
4136	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
4137	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4138	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
4139	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, @DRUG$ like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
4140	DDI-advise	These results would seem to dictate against the clinical use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, or during the period following ELSPAR therapy when plasma asparagine levels are below normal.
4141	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
4142	DDI-advise	Serum lithium levels should be monitored frequently if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
4143	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
4144	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
4145	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
4146	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthines, or metoclopramide.
4147	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
4148	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
4149	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
4150	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and @DRUG$.
4151	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), @DRUG$ (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
4152	DDI-advise	Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
4153	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be withdrawn at least 48 hours before conducting an @DRUG$-mediated stress test.
4154	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
4155	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
4156	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, @DRUG$, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
4157	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
4158	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4159	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
4160	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or @DRUG$, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
4161	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
4162	DDI-advise	Other 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of treatment with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
4163	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is withdrawn from the combination therapy, @DRUG$ dose should then be reduced.
4164	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or
4165	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
4166	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
4167	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), @DRUG$, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
4168	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, @DRUG$, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
4169	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
4170	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, @DRUG$, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
4171	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4172	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as @DRUG$ and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
4173	DDI-advise	Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
4174	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
4175	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
4176	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
4177	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
4178	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
4179	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
4180	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
4181	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
4182	DDI-advise	Based on these data, @DRUG$ should not be used in patients on @DRUG$ therapy.
4183	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
4184	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including @DRUG$, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
4185	DDI-advise	Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with @DRUG$ to extend the half-life of @DRUG$ is not recommended.
4186	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
4187	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as @DRUG$ and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4188	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
4189	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
4190	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
4191	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
4192	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in anaesthetised horses.
4193	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin).
4194	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
4195	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
4196	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
4197	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
4198	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, @DRUG$, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
4199	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
