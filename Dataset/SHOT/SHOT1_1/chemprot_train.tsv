0	CPR:4	@CHEMICAL$ and the p-chloro analogue inhibited the actin-activated @GENE$ activity of smooth muscle myosin (IC50 = 25.1 microM).
1	CPRFalse	In membranes of control but not of @CHEMICAL$-treated cells, @GENE$ via alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive GTP analog [alpha-32P]GTP azidoanilide into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of Gi2, Go2, and the not further identified Go subtype.
2	CPR:3	Upon co-exposure to @CHEMICAL$ and TCDD, V(5+) significantly potentiated the TCDD-mediated induction of the Cyp1a1, @GENE$, and Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24 h. In vitro, V(5+) decreased the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels.
3	CPR:6	These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and @CHEMICAL$ antagonist actions of @GENE$.
4	CPR:9	Carnitine acetyltransferases (@CHEMICAL$) catalyze the reversible conversion of acetyl-CoA and @GENE$ to acetylcarnitine and free CoA. To redesign the specificity of rat CrAT toward its substrates, we mutated Met564.
5	CPR:5	The @CHEMICAL$ agonist CGS21680 (@GENE$) (0.001-0.1 mM) did not alter NE oxidation currents.
