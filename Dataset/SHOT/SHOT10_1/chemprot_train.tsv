3	CPRFalse	These results indicate that, similar to the sulfonylureas, mitiglinide is highly specific to the Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, i.e., the pancreatic beta-cell @CHEM-GENE$, and suggest that mitiglinide may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug.
4	CPRFalse	However, @CHEMICAL$ receptor blockers differ from ACE inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to @GENE$ or other mediators such as substance P.
5	CPRFalse	S1P activated @CHEM-GENE$ (PI3K)/Akt signaling, leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3b and the nuclear translocation of b-catenin, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by b-catenin/T-cell factor complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells.
6	CPR:3	Upon co-exposure to @CHEMICAL$ and TCDD, V(5+) significantly potentiated the TCDD-mediated induction of the Cyp1a1, @GENE$, and Cyp1b1 mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24 h.

7	CPRFalse	@CHEMICAL$, is a synthetic malononitrilamide that targets the critical enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis, dihydroorotic acid dehydrogenase, and @GENE$ has completed phase II trials.
8	CPRFalse	Change in affinity for cGMP, @CHEMICAL$, sildenafil, or IBMX in Y612F, H613A, @GENE$, or F786A was less, but affinity of H613A or F786A for tadalafil was weakened 37- and 17-fold, respectively.
9	CPRFalse	Absorption and secretion of fluoride increase at acid pH levels, possibly because of its non-ionized state at these pHs and/or because of participation of a @CHEM-GENE$ or a F(-)/OH(-) antiporter.
10	CPRFalse	In intact animals, neutralization of the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous @CHEMICAL$ leads to an increased @GENE$ and testosterone secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the level of the prostate and seminal vesicles.
11	CPRFalse	A GRP targeting ligand, J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH(2) (J-G-Abz4-t-BBN), and an Y1 targeting ligand, INP-K[e-J-(a-DO3A-e-DGa)-K]-YRLRY-NH(2)([e-J-(a-DO3A-e-DGa)-K]-BVD-15), were synthesized and coupled to produce the heterobivalent ligand, @CHEMICAL$/BVD15-DO3A.

12	CPR:4	PURPOSE: Testosterone-to-estradiol ratio levels in infertile men improve during treatment with the @CHEMICAL$ inhibitor, @GENE$, and resulting changes in semen parameters.
13	CPR:3	These findings suggest that @CHEMICAL$ activates the PI3K/@GENE$ signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of b-catenin in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of osteoptotegerin and osteoblast differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.

17	CPR:4	These effects were fully counteracted by dietary @CHEMICAL$ which inhibited ROS overproduction and GSH consumption, rendered the reactive transcription of glutathione-associated enzymes unnecessary and blocked the intracellular signals leading to the overexpression and rearrangement of @GENE$ signalling molecule.
18	CPR:4	A series of phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, @CHEMICAL$, syringic acid, quercetin, and ellagic acid, were investigated for their inhibitory effects against the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (@GENE$, EC 4.2.1.1).

22	CPR:4	However, @CHEMICAL$ at low concentrations causes slow inhibition of GluR5 kainate receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, indicating that it may protect against seizures, at least in part, through suppression of @GENE$ kainate receptor responses.

25	CPR:9	Using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the @CHEMICAL$ variant towards substrates @GENE$ and rosuvastatin are similar to the well-characterized full length variant.
26	CPR:9	They all expressed ASS, but not ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the enzyme that converts ornithine, the product of degradation of arginine with @CHEMICAL$, to @GENE$, which is converted back to arginine via ASS.
27	CPR:9	We examined the N-demethylation of individual @CHEMICAL$ enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the @GENE$ allele, insect cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant CYP2B6.1 and CYP2B6.6 protein variant.
28	CPR:9	We also shortly discuss the ongoing debate on whether @CHEMICAL$ is the actual reaction product of @GENE$ catalysis, as well as the phenomenon of NO-mediated autoinhibition.

37	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ (10(-5) M), a selective @GENE$ antagonist, showed no effect on the PGE1- or PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that PGE1- and PGE2-induced inhibition of the HVA Ca2+ channels is possibly mediated by the EP3 receptor.
38	CPR:3	"Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 mM but not 1 mM. Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity; however, only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K(ATP) channels, and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone (5 mM) did not stimulate insulin secretion, but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+). 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of @CHEMICAL$ secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB (25 mM) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor @GENE$ (1 mM)."
39	CPR:3	Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of @CHEMICAL$ mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (@GENE$), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme.

43	CPR:6	EP(1) and @CHEMICAL$ antagonists @GENE$ and ONO-AE3-240, but not the EP(4) antagonists ONO-AE3-208 and AH 23848, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of EP(1) and EP(3) but not EP(4) for MB growth.
44	CPR:3	Moreover, @CHEMICAL$-induced increases in CysLT(1)R and NF-kB @GENE$ in the brain were also attenuated by pranlukast.

50	CPR:6	Combination treatment with the selective @CHEMICAL$ antagonist @GENE$ produced a dose-dependent augmentation of venlafaxine-induced (3-30 mg/kg s.c) extracellular 5-HT concentrations, but had no further effect on NA above that produced by venlafaxine alone.
51	CPR:6	@CHEMICAL$ (LY139037), a selective @GENE$ antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion.
52	CPR:5	The involvement of EP1 and EP2 receptors is indicated by studies with the @CHEMICAL$ selective agonist 17-phenyl trinor PGE2, and the EP2 selective agonist butaprost (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists SC-51089 (EP1 specific) and @GENE$ (EP1 and EP2 specific).
53	CPR:5	@CHEMICAL$ (DEX), betamethasone (BM), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either @GENE$.

55	CPR:5	Systemic administration of @CHEMICAL$ agonists, @GENE$ and salmeterol, elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats at micromolar doses. beta(2)-Adrenoceptor agonists provide a potential therapy for muscle wasting and weakness, but their use may be limited by adverse effects on the heart, mediated in part, by beta(1)-adrenoceptor activation.
56	CPR:5	Methanandamide (10.0 mg/kg) had lesser effect than other CB agonists, and the @CHEMICAL$ agonist @GENE$ [1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2-iodo-5-nitrobenzoyl)indole], the anandamide transport inhibitor AM404, and the CB antagonist rimonabant did not have diuretic effects.
