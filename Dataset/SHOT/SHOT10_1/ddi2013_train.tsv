21	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ during therapy with a @DRUG$ has been shown to produce a  stimulating  effect in some depressed patients.
22	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
23	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.

27	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
