334	CPRFalse	These currents were produced by @CHEM-GENE$ (GLAST) (excitatory amino acid transporter 1) because they were weakly inhibited by dihydrokainate, an antagonist of glutamate transporter-1 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) and were absent from IPCs in GLAST-/- cochleas.
335	CPR:4	While the substituted @CHEMICAL$ prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block @GENE$ receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-HT4 receptor.

361	CPRFalse	The altered activities of key enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of carbohydrate metabolism significantly (p<0.05) increased whereas hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, @CHEMICAL$ dehydrogenase and glycogen content significantly (p<0.05) decreased in the liver of diabetic rats and also increased activities of @GENE$ (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

379	CPRFalse	All @CHEMICAL$ constructs had similar affinities for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, sildenafil, tadalafil, and UK-122764, but mutants containing a complete GAF-B had 7- to 18-fold higher affinity for vardenafil-based compounds compared with those lacking a complete GAF-B.
