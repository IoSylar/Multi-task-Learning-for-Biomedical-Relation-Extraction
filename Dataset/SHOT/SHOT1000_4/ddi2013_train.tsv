1237	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
1238	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
1239	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to @DRUG$ and angiotensin II receptor antagonists increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).

1248	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
1249	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1250	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of @DRUG$, and a high dose of naloxone (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin (16 micrograms).
1251	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), @DRUG$, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1252	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other related compounds (eg, quinine, @DRUG$ and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions.
1253	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ interferes with the absorption of @DRUG$, including vitamin D preparations.
1254	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, @DRUG$.
1255	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
1256	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
1257	DDI-advise	If intravenous @DRUG$ is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with @DRUG$ should be interrupted.
1258	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
1259	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.
1260	DDI-effect	The concomitant use of @DRUG$s, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some @DRUG$ may result in severe hypertension.
1261	DDI-effect	Aminoglycosides: The mixing of @DRUG$ with an @DRUG$ in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.
1262	DDI-effect	The potential for increased sedation when @DRUG$ is given with other @DRUG$ should be appreciated.
1263	DDI-effect	Theophylline-related adverse effects have occurred in patients when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered.
1264	DDI-effect	Warfarin and @DRUG$: Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
1265	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, @DRUG$ and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1266	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, @DRUG$) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
1267	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1268	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
1269	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic or @DRUG$;"
1270	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use with @DRUG$ or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
1271	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
1272	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, @DRUG$, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
1273	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
1274	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, @DRUG$, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
1275	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
1276	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1277	DDI-effect	Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$, and it is possible that the administration of @DRUG$ as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
1278	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1279	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
1280	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
1281	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1282	DDI-mechanism	In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of @DRUG$ dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain cyclosporine trough concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of @DRUG$.
1283	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
1284	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
1285	DDI-effect	Methotrexate - There is one report that @DRUG$ may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental @DRUG$ for chemotherapy-induced mucositis.
1286	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: @DRUG$, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
1287	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing magnesium or @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
1288	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
1289	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

1292	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., @DRUG$, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
1293	DDI-effect	These results suggest that exposure to environmental @DRUG$ may alter the biological and behavioral responsiveness of an animal to @DRUG$.
1294	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1297	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
1298	DDI-effect	As with some other @DRUG$, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by NUROMAX is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
1299	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
1300	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, @DRUG$, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

1302	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, @DRUG$, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1303	DDI-effect	It would be expected that @DRUG$ use during therapy with @DRUG$ would worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea, but this has not been studied.
1304	DDI-effect	- The action of sulphonylureas and @DRUG$ may be enhanced by @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
1305	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
1306	DDI-effect	In one controlled clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including @DRUG$, were reported to prolong the action of @DRUG$.
1307	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
1308	DDI-mechanism	Oral Contraceptives: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and an oral contraceptive increased AUC values for norethindrone and @DRUG$ by approximately 30% and 20%.

1310	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
1311	DDI-mechanism	These alterations in @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics produced by @DRUG$ explain the increase in serum digoxin level that has been observed when this drug combination has been used clinically.
1312	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: @DRUG$ and paroxetine.
1313	DDI-effect	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
1314	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), @DRUG$ (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
1315	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1316	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1317	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium/@DRUG$-containing antacids.
1318	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to be antagonistic to @DRUG$, including ceftazidime, based on in vitro studies and time kill curves with enteric gram-negative bacilli.

1320	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
1321	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1322	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (@DRUG$, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
1323	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
1324	DDI-effect	In one controlled clinical study, the ureidopenicillins, including @DRUG$, were reported to prolong the action of @DRUG$.

1327	DDI-effect	Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were used in combination.
1328	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
1329	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
1330	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium- sparing and @DRUG$.
1331	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
1332	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
1333	DDI-mechanism	In addition to this pharmacological interaction, this report describes a novel chemical reaction between @DRUG$ (a benzodiazepine) and @DRUG$ under acidic conditions similar to those found in vivo, resulting in a 3-ethoxylated product.

1335	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
1336	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (phenobarbital or @DRUG$) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
1337	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.
1338	DDI-mechanism	Antibiotics: @DRUG$ have been reported to cause a significant decrease in @DRUG$ clearance.
1339	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
1340	DDI-mechanism	At higher than recommended doses, @DRUG$ 75 mg administered once daily for 10 days increased plasma concentrations by 23% as measured by AUC0-24hr in patients receiving @DRUG$ 7.5 to 15 mg/week for rheumatoid arthritis.
1341	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
1342	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1343	DDI-mechanism	Antacids or @DRUG$ substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
1344	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
1345	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
1346	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1347	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other @DRUG$ cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;"
1348	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (@DRUG$), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1349	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1350	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.

1356	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
1357	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
1358	DDI-effect	Other @DRUG$ that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis have been shown to interfere with thiazide diuretics in some studies and with @DRUG$.
1359	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant use of some @DRUG$.
1360	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), @DRUG$.
1361	DDI-effect	Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of @DRUG$ with imipramine and other @DRUG$ may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed.
1362	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and ketoconazole.
1363	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
1364	DDI-mechanism	Reciprocal interactions may occur with concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., phenytoin, @DRUG$, cimetidine, ketoconazole), though this has not been studied

1386	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and @DRUG$ raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1387	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of @DRUG$, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
1388	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1389	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain @DRUG$, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1390	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, @DRUG$, gentamicin, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
1391	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
1392	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ - @DRUG$ may potentiate the tardive dyskinesia side reactions of neuroleptic drugs if used concomitantly with them.
1393	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (@DRUG$, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1394	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of @DRUG$.
1395	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$, phenobarbital, phenytoin).
1396	DDI-effect	Aminoglycosides: The mixing of @DRUG$ with an @DRUG$ in vitro can result in substantial inactivation of the aminoglycoside.
1397	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1398	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, @DRUG$, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
1399	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
1400	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Following concomitant administration of a single dose of @DRUG$ to subjects receiving multiple doses of @DRUG$, M1 peak levels were increased (~40%) over those seen when ARAVA was given alone.
1401	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ or sucralfate substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
1402	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1403	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ used concurrently increases the risk of renal calculus formation.
1404	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1405	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in @DRUG$ levels with @DRUG$ co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.
1406	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, @DRUG$, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1407	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
1408	DDI-mechanism	Milk, milk products, and @DRUG$-rich foods or drugs may impair the absorption of @DRUG$.
1409	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.

1411	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with @DRUG$ as well.
1412	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
1413	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is added to @DRUG$ therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced.
1414	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the clearance of chronic high dose @DRUG$.
1415	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduces the clearance of @DRUG$.
1416	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including ganglionic blocking agents, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled @DRUG$.
1417	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
1418	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or iodine excess may decrease the effect of @DRUG$, and an iodine deficiency can increase the effect of Carbimazole.
1419	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, @DRUG$) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
1420	DDI-effect	The effect of @DRUG$ on oral @DRUG$ is variable.
1421	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
1422	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ and norepinephrine.
1423	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with diuretics (such as @DRUG$) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
1424	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1425	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other @DRUG$, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
1426	DDI-mechanism	During administration of multiple oral doses of @DRUG$ to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of @DRUG$, a 13%-19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.
1427	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, @DRUG$, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
1428	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1429	DDI-mechanism	In well-controlled patients undergoing concurrent therapy with @DRUG$, a decrease in the steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ may occur when cime-tidine therapy is discontinued.
1430	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, @DRUG$, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
1431	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1432	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1433	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients who are receiving sympathomimetic or @DRUG$ may result in an additive pressor effect .
1434	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
1435	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
1436	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$, veratrum alkaloids, methyldopa and mecamylamine.
1437	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
1438	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1439	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of one another.
1440	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with @DRUG$, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system
1441	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ may lower @DRUG$ plasma levels, possibly by competing for protein-binding sites.
1442	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, @DRUG$, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
1443	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1444	DDI-effect	Agents Causing Renin Release: The antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and enalapril IV is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., @DRUG$).
1445	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
1446	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and theobromine.
1447	DDI-effect	Administering @DRUG$ together with @DRUG$ (100-500 microM) inhibited InsP(3)-induced responses (both Ca(2+) and current responses) in a dose-dependent fashion.
1448	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, @DRUG$), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1449	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
1450	DDI-effect	Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including @DRUG$ and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with @DRUG$ on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.
1451	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;@DRUG$;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1452	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with allopurinol (100 mg/kg, ip) or @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
1453	DDI-effect	@DRUG$-induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by vitamin E or @DRUG$.
1454	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1455	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
1456	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and @DRUG$, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1457	DDI-mechanism	Hydrochlorothiazide: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide.
1458	DDI-mechanism	Antacids or @DRUG$ substantially interfere with the absorption of some @DRUG$, resulting in low urine levels.
1459	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
1460	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, @DRUG$, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
1461	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, which competes for tubular secretion, has been shown to increase the plasma half-life of dyphylline .
1462	DDI-effect	Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by @DRUG$ and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of @DRUG$.
1463	DDI-effect	In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.
1464	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, @DRUG$, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
1465	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other @DRUG$ such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
1466	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
1467	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
1468	DDI-effect	Patients receiving high doses of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites.
1469	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
1470	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1471	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as @DRUG$, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1472	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (sumatriptan succinate) and @DRUG$.
1473	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, @DRUG$, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
1474	DDI-mechanism	However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decrease in Cmax) when a 1-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered 1 minute after a 20-mg dose of @DRUG$ nasal spray.
1475	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, @DRUG$ Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
1476	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: When a single 375-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold.
1477	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
1478	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
1479	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
1480	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of @DRUG$ in both dietary cobalt treatments.
1481	DDI-effect	Both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ slow AV conduction.
1482	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of megakaryocytes with extracellular @DRUG$ (50 microM) also inhibited @DRUG$-induced responses.
1483	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
1484	DDI-mechanism	This may occur because @DRUG$ competitively displaces @DRUG$ from protein binding sites.
1485	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
1486	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
1487	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
1488	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
1489	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
1490	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
1491	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1492	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ doubled the AUC for @DRUG$.
1493	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, @DRUG$, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
1494	DDI-effect	However, another @DRUG$ has been found to produce a less than two-second increase in prothrombin time in healthy volunteers receiving low doses of @DRUG$.
1495	DDI-effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ but may be seen after several months.
1496	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, @DRUG$, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1497	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
1498	DDI-effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of @DRUG$ when @DRUG$ therapy is initiated.
1499	DDI-effect	Indomethacin - Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may ameliorate increased intestinal permeability caused by indomethacin.
1500	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including @DRUG$ and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
1501	DDI-advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg @DRUG$ dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$.
1502	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
1503	DDI-advise	Lithium serum concentrations should be monitored closely when initiating or changing therapy with @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1504	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, alcohol, and other CNS depressants.
1505	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin).
1506	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ may render oral contraceptives less effective.
1507	DDI-effect	Hyperpyrexia has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
1508	DDI-mechanism	Inhibitors of CYP1A2: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, results in approximately a 6-fold increase in AUC and about a 2.5-fold increase in Cmax of duloxetine.
1509	DDI-effect	"Both @DRUG$ and 18-MC block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
1510	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
1511	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1512	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, caution should be used when administering @DRUG$ concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., @DRUG$).
1513	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving @DRUG$ 450 mg BID with @DRUG$ 200 mg BID as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone.
1514	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1515	DDI-effect	In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with etanercept alone (0%).
1516	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
1517	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (Desyrel) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
1518	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and @DRUG$ Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1519	DDI-effect	Diuretics: @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
1520	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, @DRUG$, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1521	DDI-advise	"Patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored;"
1522	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and @DRUG$-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
1523	DDI-effect	It is not known whether this potentiation of @DRUG$ rashes is due to @DRUG$ or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.
1524	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
1525	DDI-mechanism	The effect of TORADOL on plasma lithium has not been studied, but cases of increased @DRUG$ plasma levels during @DRUG$ therapy have been reported.
1526	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter.
1527	DDI-effect	(@DRUG$ may increase the responsiveness to @DRUG$.)
1528	DDI-mechanism	In vitro, @DRUG$ may displace less firmly bound drugs like @DRUG$.
1529	DDI-effect	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Accutane and tetracyclines should be avoided because @DRUG$ use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of @DRUG$
1530	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and @DRUG$.
1531	DDI-effect	However, there has been one report of prolonged prothrombin time when @DRUG$ was added to the regimen of a patient treated with @DRUG$.
1532	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
1533	DDI-effect	Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including @DRUG$.
1534	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduced the blood AUC0-12 of @DRUG$ by approximately 20%, peak blood concentration (Cmax) by 16%, and 12-hour blood concentration (C12hr) by 26% in healthy subjects when tacrolimus (2 doses of 0.1 mg/kg 12 hours apart) was administered on the 10th day of CANCIDAS 70 mg daily, as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone.
1535	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
1536	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1537	DDI-mechanism	Geocillin (@DRUG$) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.

1540	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1541	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, @DRUG$, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1542	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ and antihypertensive agents.
1543	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic effect of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase when @DRUG$ is given concurrently.
1544	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving @DRUG$ (disulfiram, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
1545	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, @DRUG$, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1546	DDI-advise	Therefore, when using doses of @DRUG$ greater than 1200 mg/day during adjunctive therapy, a decrease in the dose of @DRUG$ may be required.
1547	DDI-effect	"In the presence of @DRUG$ (10(-5) M), @DRUG$ (10(-8) M) failed to cause the first contraction;"
1548	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of @DRUG$.
1549	DDI-effect	However, the antagonism of the @DRUG$-induced anxiogenic effects by @DRUG$ was only observed in the time spent in the light zone, and DPCPX-induced anxiogenic effects were neither reversed by CGS 21680 nor by CPA.
1550	DDI-effect	In patients who have received muscle relaxants, @DRUG$ may temporarily mask the residual effects of @DRUG$.
1551	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
1552	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of morphine, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.

1555	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1556	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and produces an increase in the level of ciprofloxacin in serum.
1557	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used together.
1558	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

1560	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, @DRUG$, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
1561	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$: a drug interaction.
1562	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, @DRUG$, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1563	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
1564	DDI-mechanism	Elevated plasma levels of @DRUG$ have been reported with concomitant @DRUG$ use.
1565	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with midazolam or @DRUG$ has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.

1567	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving @DRUG$, procaine, or thiazolesulfone.
1568	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
1569	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
1570	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1571	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or enflurane administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
1572	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of @DRUG$.
1573	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised if an @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, such as @DRUG$, spironolactone, and cimetidine.

1575	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum @DRUG$, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
1576	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
1577	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
1578	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
1579	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1580	DDI-effect	Antagonism has been demonstrated between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.

1582	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either ketoconazole or @DRUG$ led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
1583	DDI-mechanism	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The administration of @DRUG$ to normal volunteers receiving @DRUG$ decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
1584	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in increased serum haloperidol concentrations.
1585	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
1586	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
1587	DDI-effect	In ewes given 40 mg of @DRUG$/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present.
1588	DDI-effect	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of @DRUG$.

1590	DDI-advise	Although concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant carbamazepine administration may result in an increase in Clozapine plasma levels.
1591	DDI-advise	Because @DRUG$ have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on @DRUG$ therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.
1592	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
1593	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
1594	DDI-effect	There have been reports of theophylline-related side effects in patients on concomitant therapy with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.

1598	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1599	DDI-effect	In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone.
1600	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.

1602	DDI-advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near 70 mg/dL, dose adjustment for @DRUG$ (5 mg QD and 10 mg BID) with @DRUG$ coadministration (up to 40 mg QD) is not indicated.
1603	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents (@DRUG$, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
1604	DDI-effect	Glyburide: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with the sulfonylurea @DRUG$ has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia.

1606	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing @DRUG$ or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
1607	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
1608	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (@DRUG$, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

1610	DDI-effect	Doxorubicin: @DRUG$ caused a decrease in @DRUG$ phosphorylation ( 50% inhibition of total phosphate formation) in U937/Molt 4 cells.
1611	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
1612	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, @DRUG$ (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
1613	DDI-effect	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ have resulted in previous reports of rhabdomyolysis.
1614	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
1615	DDI-advise	The following precautions should be kept in mind in the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning although they do not bear directly on the use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1616	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
1617	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and @DRUG$.
1618	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used in patients receiving @DRUG$..

1653	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1654	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
1655	DDI-effect	1- adrenergic receptor antagonism, @DRUG$ has the potential to enhance the effect of certain @DRUG$.
1656	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or @DRUG$) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.

1675	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 10 mg in a 72- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
1676	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of Felbatol  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
1677	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (@DRUG$), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"

1687	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and @DRUG$.
1688	DDI-mechanism	Another oral azole antifungal, @DRUG$, inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastermizole which may prolong QT intervals.
1689	DDI-effect	- Methotrexate (e.g., Mexate) Use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may increase the chance of side effects affecting the liver and/or the side effects of methotrexate
1690	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.

1716	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1717	DDI-effect	The successive application of @DRUG$ (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
1718	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
1719	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.

1728	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
1729	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
1730	DDI-effect	Prior administration of @DRUG$ (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of @DRUG$ (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
1731	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain @DRUG$ such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.

1861	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (@DRUG$, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
1862	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
1863	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including @DRUG$ or its derivatives or similar agents.
1864	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
1865	DDI-effect	An additive hypotensive effect has been reported with the combination of systemic @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ therapy.
1866	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$ during therapy with @DRUG$.
1867	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
1868	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
1869	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace @DRUG$s, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.
1870	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
1871	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, @DRUG$, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1872	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
1873	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
1874	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in T24 cells, but dose-dependently inhibits the effects of @DRUG$ when both are added simultaneously.
1875	DDI-mechanism	Leucovorin: The concentration of @DRUG$ is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by @DRUG$.
1876	DDI-effect	Synergism between xanthine bronchodilators (e.g., theophylline), @DRUG$, and other @DRUG$ has been reported.
1877	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1878	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
1879	DDI-effect	Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.
1880	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
1881	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1882	DDI-effect	Pyrazolone Derivatives (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly @DRUG$): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
1883	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
1884	DDI-effect	Clinically significant effects have been reported with the @DRUG$ when used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1885	DDI-advise	Renal function should be monitored carefully if high doses of @DRUG$ are to be administered with @DRUG$ because of the increased potential of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
1886	DDI-advise	SUBUTEX and @DRUG$ should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
1887	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, tacrolimus or digoxin has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
1888	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or @DRUG$ administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
1889	DDI-effect	Co-administration: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with antiplatelet agents, @DRUG$, and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.
1890	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, @DRUG$, phenytoin).
1891	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may interact with the @DRUG$ preparation causing a gritty substance to form or may interact with the preservative in the idoxuridine preparation causing a toxic effect in the eye.
1892	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of @DRUG$ in both dietary cobalt treatments.
1893	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (@DRUG$ and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
1894	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
1895	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
1896	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and @DRUG$), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
1897	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including cinoxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
1898	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
1899	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, @DRUG$-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
1900	DDI-effect	The administration of local @DRUG$ containing epinephrine or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
1901	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ increases both free and bound @DRUG$ by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
1902	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
1903	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and @DRUG$ may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
1904	DDI-mechanism	Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers ( @DRUG$, phenobarbital, carbamazepine ) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of @DRUG$ elimination.
1905	DDI-effect	Preliminary data which suggest that @DRUG$ may inhibit the anti-inflammatory activity of @DRUG$ have not been confirmed.
1906	DDI-mechanism	In patients given very high doses (3900 mg) of @DRUG$ daily, increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when @DRUG$, 150 mg b.i.d., was administered concurrently.
1907	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
1908	DDI-effect	Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
1909	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: @DRUG$ may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of @DRUG$.
1910	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, @DRUG$, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
1911	DDI-advise	If it is necessary to continue the @DRUG$, initiate therapy with @DRUG$ at a dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized.
1912	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
1913	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, iron salts and @DRUG$).
1914	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
1915	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as @DRUG$, phenobarbital, rifampin), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
1916	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
1917	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
1918	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
1919	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$.
1920	DDI-advise	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
1921	DDI-effect	Alpha-blockers: When @DRUG$ 10 or 20 mg was given to healthy volunteers either simultaneously or 6 hours after a 10 mg dose of @DRUG$, significant hypotension developed in a substantial number of subjects.
1922	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other @DRUG$, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
1923	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral @DRUG$, warfarin, or its derivatives.
1924	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
1925	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and @DRUG$), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1926	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
1927	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$ causes a slight decrease (about 10%) in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
1928	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with PRINIVIL can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
1929	DDI-effect	Infusion requirements of NIMBEX in patients administered @DRUG$ prior to infusions of @DRUG$ were comparable to or slightly greater than when succinylcholine was not administered.
1930	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1931	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and morphine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) inhibited the @DRUG$ (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.)-induced diarrhea in cecectomized rats.
1932	DDI-effect	The anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$ is enhanced by concurrent treatment with @DRUG$ (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency.
1933	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1934	DDI-effect	Exacerbation or the initial presentation of a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders has been observed following concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo-bulbar myasthenia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous pemphigoid, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
1935	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
1936	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is added to or withdrawn from treatment, dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required.
1937	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, @DRUG$ salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
1938	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, @DRUG$, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
1939	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with @DRUG$/aluminum-containing antacids.
1940	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of @DRUG$-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
1941	DDI-effect	Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when @DRUG$ was administered to rats treated with @DRUG$ 8 hours before the ethanol challenge.
1942	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain @DRUG$ or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
1943	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, @DRUG$, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
1944	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
1945	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, @DRUG$, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
1946	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
1947	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
1948	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
1949	DDI-effect	The successive application of @DRUG$ (5 or 10 mg/kg egg weight (e.w.) and @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg e.w.) in a 10 min interval significantly increased the activation of spontaneous motility of 17-day-old chick embryos in comparison with the effect of glutamate alone.
1950	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, @DRUG$, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
1951	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
1952	DDI-effect	Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals.
1953	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, cyclosporin for injection concentrate and @DRUG$ for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
1954	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous opiate such as @DRUG$.
1955	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, @DRUG$ and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
1956	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with @DRUG$ (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%.
1957	DDI-effect	Cardiac effects of @DRUG$ are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol and @DRUG$.
1958	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
1959	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg twice daily with food isrecommended in combination with @DRUG$.
1960	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine: Coadministration of a 10-mg single dose of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, by 35%.
1961	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
1962	DDI-effect	Antidiabetic Agents: Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$.
1963	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
1964	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
1965	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, @DRUG$, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
1966	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
1967	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
1968	DDI-effect	Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines.
1969	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, @DRUG$, thioxanthines, or metoclopramide.
1970	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;@DRUG$;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
1971	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of @DRUG$.
1972	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered with warfarin or its derivatives.
1973	DDI-mechanism	Furthermore it has been proposed that @DRUG$ resulted In induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested @DRUG$ being converted to the toxic metabolites.
1974	DDI-effect	Thiazide Diuretics: The reports that the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may contribute to the enhancement of allopurinol toxicity in some patients have been reviewed in an attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship and a mechanism of causation.
1975	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic drugs.
1976	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
1977	DDI-effect	The effects of concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on the PR interval were less than additive.
1978	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, @DRUG$, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
1979	DDI-effect	Catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$, may have an additive effect when given with @DRUG$.
1980	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: @DRUG$, tetracyclines, nicotine, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
1981	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and @DRUG$ such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
1982	DDI-effect	Quinolones, including @DRUG$, may enhance the effects of oral @DRUG$, such as warfarin or its derivatives.
1983	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, @DRUG$, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
1984	DDI-effect	Therefore, concurrent use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may render these contraceptives less effective.
1985	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used cautiously in conjunction with @DRUG$ in hypoprothrombinemia.
1986	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, itraconazole;"
1987	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
1988	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
1989	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
1990	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
1991	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
1992	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin, nicotine, and @DRUG$ may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
1993	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for @DRUG$ and ethinyl estradiol.
1994	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
1995	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or @DRUG$).
1996	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of @DRUG$ or proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.

2129	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent @DRUG$ such as furosemide.
2130	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with @DRUG$, including ibuprofen, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
2131	DDI-mechanism	Intravenous @DRUG$ was shown to double the bioavailability of oral @DRUG$.
2132	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15% when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
2133	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
2134	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: Aprepitant, when given as a regimen of 125mg with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and @DRUG$ when given as 80 mg/day with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
2135	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2136	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, warfarin, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
2137	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
2138	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2139	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like @DRUG$ or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other should be avoided.
2140	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.

2152	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
2153	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, specifically, dacarbazine, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
2154	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2155	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that @DRUG$ like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
2156	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.

2158	DDI-mechanism	Rifabutin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in a 32% decrease in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 207% increase in rifabutin plasma A.C.
2159	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels.
2160	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, @DRUG$, and sertraline.
2161	DDI-mechanism	Dexamethasone: Steady-state trough concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were about 56% higher when 8 mg @DRUG$ was coadministered with each dose of @DRUG$ (15 mg/kg/day) in eight neurocysticercosis patients.

2163	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2164	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
2165	DDI-effect	In combination with other @DRUG$, @DRUG$ may still kill even experienced users, particularly if their tolerance to the drug has reduced or the strength of their usual dose has increased.
2166	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
2167	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2168	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2169	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2170	DDI-effect	Warfarin: @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant, @DRUG$, or its derivatives.
2171	DDI-advise	Oral Anticoagulants CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN @DRUG$ ARE GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH @DRUG$.
2172	DDI-mechanism	Oral @DRUG$ inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and @DRUG$.

2174	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases.
2175	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2176	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, @DRUG$, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2177	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous @DRUG$ (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
2178	DDI-effect	Patients treated with @DRUG$ may be resistant to the effects of @DRUG$.
2179	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain @DRUG$ (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
2180	DDI-effect	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2181	DDI-effect	Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and @DRUG$ may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.

2183	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen and methotrexate - @DRUG$ may decrease hepatic toxicity in those with acetaminophen overdosage or in those taking @DRUG$.
2184	DDI-advise	A dose increase of lopinavir/@DRUG$ to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
2185	DDI-mechanism	The oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ is reduced by 60% with coadministration of @DRUG$.
2186	DDI-effect	In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 25 mg daily of @DRUG$ with the ACE inhibitor @DRUG$, 10 to 40 mg for 4 weeks, was associated with an average increase in mean arterial pressure of about 3 mm Hg compared to ACE inhibitor alone.
2187	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2188	DDI-effect	Paclitaxel - In one report, @DRUG$ at a dose of 10 grams three times daily, given 24 hours after receiving @DRUG$, appeared to prevent the development of myalgia and arthralgia, adverse reactions of paclitaxel.
2189	DDI-effect	Particular caution is necessary when using @DRUG$ in cases of mixed drug overdosage since the toxic effects (such as convulsions and cardiac dysrhythmias) of other drugs taken in overdose (especially @DRUG$) may emerge with the reversal of the benzodiazepine effect by flumazenil.
2190	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, and @DRUG$ may be reduced by @DRUG$.
2191	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2192	DDI-effect	If a @DRUG$ is also used, it may increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
2193	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
2194	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
2195	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
2196	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
2197	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of @DRUG$.
2198	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as @DRUG$, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
2199	DDI-effect	Two percent of patients treated concurrently with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ developed neutropenia (ANC  1 x 109/L).
2200	DDI-effect	In addition, @DRUG$ alone can inhibit adrenal @DRUG$ synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal.
2201	DDI-advise	Diazepam: The co-administration of @DRUG$ Tablets and @DRUG$ is generally not advisable.
2202	DDI-effect	Hypertensive crises have resulted when @DRUG$ have been used concomitantly within14 days following use of @DRUG$.
2203	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
2204	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and @DRUG$, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
2205	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen: The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite.
2206	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
2207	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
2208	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, @DRUG$ and mecamylamine.
2209	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other sympathomimetic drugs (such as @DRUG$) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
2210	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
2211	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
2212	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, @DRUG$) should be approached with caution.
2213	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2214	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$ chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
2215	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ given concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
2216	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
2217	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective @DRUG$ (MAOIs) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2218	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2219	DDI-advise	Although this interaction has not been reported with cinoxacin, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ is given concomitantly with @DRUG$-containing products.
2220	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, alcohol, and other @DRUG$.
2221	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/@DRUG$ or zidovudine.
2222	DDI-effect	The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity as well as the vascular dilation associated with @DRUG$ may be potentiated by @DRUG$.
2223	DDI-mechanism	Diltiazem: In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of @DRUG$ once daily, as a tablet formulation comparable to 230 mg of the capsule formulation, with @DRUG$ 120 mg 3 times daily for 5 days, resulted in a 2-fold increase of aprepitant AUC and a simultaneous 1.7-fold increase of diltiazem AUC.
2224	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2225	DDI-effect	The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing @DRUG$ or norepinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$ may produce severe, prolonged hypotension or hypertension.
2226	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
2227	DDI-effect	However, LDL-C reduction was greater when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were coadministered than when either drug was given alone.
2228	DDI-mechanism	Verapamil: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in a 24% increase in plasma concentrations of almotriptan.
2229	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and @DRUG$.)
2230	DDI-effect	The @DRUG$-induced neuronal damage produced a tolerance to the disruptive effects of amphetamine and a supersensitivity to the disruptive effects of @DRUG$ in rats responding in a schedule controlled paradigm.
2231	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs, such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of @DRUG$;"
2232	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2233	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
2234	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either @DRUG$ or minocycline.
2235	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2236	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
2237	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.

2242	DDI-effect	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2243	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2244	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of @DRUG$ may be required or adenosine may not be effective.
2245	DDI-mechanism	1- nc denotes a mean change of less than 10% 2- Pediatrics 3- Mean increase in adults at high Trileptal doses In vivo, the plasma levels of @DRUG$ increased by up to 40%, when @DRUG$ was given at doses above 1200 mg/day.
2246	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
2247	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing @DRUG$, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2248	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2249	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
2250	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2251	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
2252	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2253	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all @DRUG$, including diclofenac, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
2254	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or aluminum.
2255	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, @DRUG$, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
2256	DDI-mechanism	[The effect of cimetidine on the renal excretion of verografin and iodamide in dogs]  The intravenous injection of @DRUG$ in a dose of 20 mg/kg enhanced @DRUG$ and iodamide excretion in chronic canine experiments.
2257	DDI-effect	Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$-type drugs.
2258	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ decreased the plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ by approximately 40%.
2259	DDI-effect	Haloperidol: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine receptors, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$.
2260	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain @DRUG$ (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2261	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2262	DDI-mechanism	Resins: Since bile acid sequestrants may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take @DRUG$ at least 1 hour before or 4-6 hours after a @DRUG$ to avoid impeding its absorption.
2263	DDI-mechanism	The coadministration of @DRUG$ decreases the biologic half-life of @DRUG$ because of an increase in metabolic clearance that results in a greater amount of hydroxylated fenoprofen in the urine.
2264	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
2265	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
2266	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2267	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ Injection and @DRUG$ in a wax matrix may increase the severity of potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions as a result of a slower gastrointestinal transit time.
2268	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including @DRUG$ or its derivatives or similar agents.
2269	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
2270	DDI-advise	- Drugs with ototoxic potential: Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered @DRUG$ in patients to whom @DRUG$ are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.
2271	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
2272	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ was applied to the muscle in the presence of @DRUG$, both first and second contractile responses to PTX were abolished.
2273	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Demonstrated to be CYP 3A Inhibitors of Possible Clinical Significance on the Basis of Clinical Studies Involving Alprazolam (caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam): Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 46%, decreased clearance by 21%, increased half-life by 17%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.
2274	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes (P = .005); this was prevented by @DRUG$ (P = .004)."
2275	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2276	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
2277	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
2278	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (@DRUG$, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
2279	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric Agents: Since the excretion of oxipurinol is similar to that of urate, @DRUG$, which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of @DRUG$ and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.
2280	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or @DRUG$, and iron-containing preparations.
2281	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.
2282	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as @DRUG$ or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
2283	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
2284	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids, Methylxanthines and Diuretics: Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or @DRUG$ may potentiate a possible hypokalemic effect of  @DRUG$
2285	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (@DRUG$, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with @DRUG$ reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril.
2286	DDI-advise	Because of the small effect on half-life, the coadministration with @DRUG$ to extend the half-life of @DRUG$ is not recommended.
2287	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ as compared to a non-matched historicalcontrol group resulted in a 30%, 27%, and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax, andCmin, respectively.
2288	DDI-effect	"Drugs that reportedly may increase oral @DRUG$ response, ie, increased prothrombin response, in man include:@DRUG$*;"
2289	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2290	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes (P = .005); this was prevented by @DRUG$ (P = .004)."
2291	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
2292	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, @DRUG$, simvastatin).
2293	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other @DRUG$ have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
2294	DDI-effect	Intraventricular injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 1.2 to 12 micrograms equally antagonized in a dose-dependent manner the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin and @DRUG$.
2295	DDI-effect	Although @DRUG$ have been shown to reduce @DRUG$-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension seen with PROLEUKIN.
2296	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, @DRUG$) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2297	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
2298	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2299	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, @DRUG$ such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, methadone.
2300	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the ergot alkaloid class, of which D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2301	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2302	DDI-effect	Additive CNS depression may occur when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
2303	DDI-advise	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a @DRUG$ and initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
2304	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: @DRUG$, Phenytoin(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
2305	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$;"
2306	DDI-effect	Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$-type drugs.
2307	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that @DRUG$, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or @DRUG$, may diminish the effectiveness of APOKYN.
2308	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (for the treatment of hypotension related to obstetric blocks) and @DRUG$ may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.
2309	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2310	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
2311	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
2312	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, @DRUG$.
2313	DDI-effect	Injection of @DRUG$ 5 min before a nonlethal dose of @DRUG$ changed the serum sex steroid hormone response of male rats to endotoxin.
2314	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2315	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that ketoconazole or @DRUG$ co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
2316	DDI-mechanism	Other @DRUG$ have demonstrated moderate to marked interference with the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a reduced clearance, a prolongation of plasma half-life, and an increase in symptoms that accompany high levels of caffeine.
2317	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and @DRUG$.
2318	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2319	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have an additive CNS depressant effect when given with either diazepam, secobarbitone sodium, alcohol or @DRUG$.
2320	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as @DRUG$, epinephrine, and norepinephrine because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
2321	DDI-effect	This may indicate that @DRUG$ could enhance the toxicity of @DRUG$.
2322	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or @DRUG$ (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
2323	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other @DRUG$ and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba).
2324	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
2325	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ augments the action of non-depolarising muscle relaxants and the muscle relaxant effects of @DRUG$.
2326	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: When @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered.
2327	DDI-mechanism	Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC by 2/3.
2328	DDI-advise	Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be avoided because Accutane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines
2329	DDI-effect	As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that @DRUG$ may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, @DRUG$, and alcohol.
2330	DDI-mechanism	Since the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$ were studied in patients treated with @DRUG$, the clearance of BUSULFEX at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.
2331	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, @DRUG$, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2332	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the effects of other @DRUG$.
2333	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain @DRUG$, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2334	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2335	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, @DRUG$, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2336	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
2337	DDI-advise	If leprosy-associated inflammatory reactions develop in patients being treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is still advisable to continue treatment with both drugs.
2338	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain @DRUG$ such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2339	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, warfarin, @DRUG$ or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
2340	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed @DRUG$-containing minipill preparations.
2341	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
2342	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were administered concomitantly.
2343	DDI-advise	In the presence of these @DRUG$, larger doses of adenosine may be required or @DRUG$ may not be effective.
2344	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of @DRUG$ such as dopamine or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
2345	DDI-effect	Increased ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2346	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin @DRUG$ midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
2347	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of @DRUG$ and levodopa.
2348	DDI-effect	"May interact with the following: @DRUG$, colestipol (use with @DRUG$ may prevent the diuretic from working properly;"
2349	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the @DRUG$ and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
2350	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
2351	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
2352	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, @DRUG$, methyldopa and mecamylamine.
2353	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including @DRUG$, supplements or vitamins).
2354	DDI-mechanism	"There was a small decrease in the clearance of @DRUG$ caused by a 400-mg dose of @DRUG$;"
2355	DDI-effect	Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of @DRUG$ and 75 - 150 mg of @DRUG$.
2356	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2357	DDI-effect	Concomitant administration of other @DRUG$ may potentiate the undesirable effects of @DRUG$.
2358	DDI-mechanism	Magnesium- and aluminum-containing @DRUG$, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
2359	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2360	DDI-mechanism	In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of @DRUG$ per day decreases @DRUG$ blood levels approximately 20%.
2361	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as @DRUG$, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2362	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2363	DDI-mechanism	The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$, a highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9.
2364	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, @DRUG$, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
2365	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
2366	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2367	DDI-effect	Sumatriptan: @DRUG$ has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.
2368	DDI-effect	In clinical trials in patients undergoing PTCA/PCI, co-administration of @DRUG$ with heparin, @DRUG$, thrombolytics or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with increased risks of major bleeding events compared to patients not receiving these concomitant medications.
2369	DDI-effect	Synergism has been shown between @DRUG$ anesthesia and intravenously administered @DRUG$.
2370	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and no significant additional efficacy over use of the TNF antagonists alone.
2371	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
2372	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, @DRUG$, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2373	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
2374	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant @DRUG$ may decrease the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$.
2375	DDI-effect	Patients who begin taking @DRUG$ or who increase their diclofenac dose or any other NSAID while taking digoxin, @DRUG$, or cyclosporine may develop toxicity characteristics for these drugs.
2376	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, @DRUG$.
2377	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local @DRUG$ which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
2378	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a @DRUG$, including ciprofloxacin, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or @DRUG$ antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2379	DDI-effect	Danazol: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of @DRUG$ particularly with higher doses of @DRUG$ (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).
2380	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both dexamethasone and @DRUG$, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
2381	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
2382	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (@DRUG$), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2383	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, thioridazine and @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
2384	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ usually depresses @DRUG$ activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
2385	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulation effects of heparin or @DRUG$.
2386	DDI-mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro, @DRUG$ interferes minimally or not at all with the protein binding of salicylic acid (20% decrease in binding), tolbutamide, @DRUG$ (10% decrease in binding), or warfarin.
2387	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2388	DDI-mechanism	This might be explained by a blockade by @DRUG$ of the elimination of @DRUG$ by the liver.
2389	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and tramadol (@DRUG$).
2390	DDI-mechanism	"Cyclosporine: Combination @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations;"
2391	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2392	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as troleandomycin and @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
2393	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, @DRUG$, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
2394	DDI-advise	In patients receiving @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ concomitantly, any reduction in steroid dosage should be gradual in order to avoid the possible complications of sudden steroid withdrawal.
2395	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, @DRUG$, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2396	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of DURAGESIC  (@DRUG$ transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2397	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2398	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug @DRUG$.
2399	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
2400	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2401	DDI-advise	During concomitant therapy of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.
2402	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, @DRUG$, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
2403	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2404	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., @DRUG$) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2405	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that flurbiprofen like other @DRUG$, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
2406	DDI-advise	Patients who have been treated with @DRUG$ within two to three weeks prior to the administration of @DRUG$ should receive initial doses of dopamine HCl no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose.
2407	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2408	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
2409	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, @DRUG$, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
2410	DDI-effect	Using @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ (heart medicine) may cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood), which could increase the chance of developing an irregular heartbeat.
2411	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ (phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, and possibly dipyrone): Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
2412	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
2413	DDI-effect	When taken orally , imidazole compounds like @DRUG$ may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
2414	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2415	DDI-effect	Catecholamine-depleting Agents: Patients taking both @DRUG$ and a drug that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine and @DRUG$) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia.
2416	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
2417	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, antianxiety agents.
2418	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives in patients, the prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation test should be closely monitored if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives.
2419	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine, @DRUG$, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
2420	DDI-effect	therefore, the efficacy of oral @DRUG$ during administration of @DRUG$ may be reduced.
2421	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
2422	DDI-mechanism	Corticosteroids: Dexamethasone: @DRUG$, when given as a regimen of 125mg with @DRUG$ coadministered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and Aprepitant when given as 80 mg/day with dexamethasone coadministered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate by 2.2-fold, on Days 1 and 5.
2423	DDI-mechanism	Studies in humans show that the absorption of @DRUG$ as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before @DRUG$.
2424	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
2425	DDI-advise	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are co administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made.
2426	DDI-mechanism	However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either @DRUG$ 300 mg q.i.d. or 800 mg h.s. concomitantly with a 300 mg b.i.d. dosage of @DRUG$ (Theo-Dur , Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg h.s. regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older.
2427	DDI-effect	Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving combination regimens containing sequential high dose @DRUG$ and antineoplastic agents, specifically, @DRUG$, cis-platinum, tamoxifen and interferon-alfa.
2428	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the CNS depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ and other sedatives
2429	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other @DRUG$.
2430	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2431	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: When @DRUG$ (50 mg tid) was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged.
2432	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, @DRUG$, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
2433	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
2434	DDI-advise	Thus patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.
2435	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2436	DDI-effect	Naproxen and other @DRUG$ can reduce the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$ and other beta-blockers.
2437	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2438	DDI-mechanism	Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of @DRUG$ followed by a single dose of @DRUG$, increased Gleevec oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p 0.05) decreased mean cmax and AUC(0-8).
2439	DDI-effect	- @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$ therapy
2440	DDI-mechanism	Urinary acidifying agents These agents (ammonium chloride, @DRUG$, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
2441	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2442	DDI-advise	These increases should be considered when selecting an oral @DRUG$ for a woman taking @DRUG$.
2443	DDI-advise	If you are also using a steroid inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the @DRUG$ inhaler.
2444	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, @DRUG$(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.

2446	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (@DRUG$) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2447	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may be active in inhibiting Cryptosporidium parvum growth in vitro upon combination with either @DRUG$ or minocycline.
2448	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
2449	DDI-effect	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$ and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2450	DDI-mechanism	A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and AUC (53%) after a 1-week course of @DRUG$ 1200 mg/day and a single dose of @DRUG$ 60mg.
2451	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with allopurinol (100 mg/kg, ip) or @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
2452	DDI-mechanism	In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of @DRUG$ given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg @DRUG$ increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.
2453	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
2454	DDI-advise	When you are using @DRUG$, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are using the following: Eye product containing @DRUG$.
2455	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ used at doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$, metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
2456	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, @DRUG$), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2457	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2458	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, @DRUG$, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
2459	DDI-effect	however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking @DRUG$ therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with @DRUG$ therapy.
2460	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: @DRUG$;"
2461	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and barbiturates, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2462	DDI-effect	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2463	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of penicillins and @DRUG$ reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
2464	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
2465	DDI-effect	Co-administration: Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, and other @DRUG$ may increase the risk of bleeding.
2466	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2467	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of @DRUG$ and decrease the required infusion rate of NIMBEX.
2468	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes @DRUG$, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2469	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, @DRUG$, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2470	DDI-advise	Antacids: Enteric Coated @DRUG$ should not be given concurrently with @DRUG$, since an increase in the pH of the stomach may effect the enteric coating of the tablets.
2471	DDI-mechanism	The results raise the possibility that the ethanolysis reaction may occur in the stomach of people who consume @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ on a regular basis.
2472	DDI-effect	Vecuronium: When used in the perioperative period, @DRUG$ has been implicated in the prolongation of the neuromuscular blockade of @DRUG$.
2473	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine or @DRUG$, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2474	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, @DRUG$, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2475	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised in the coadministration of @DRUG$ Inhalation Aerosol with other @DRUG$-containing drugs.
2476	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, @DRUG$, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
2477	DDI-mechanism	Although not observed in this study, adverse effects could potentially arise from co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ by inhibition of tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter systems.
2478	DDI-mechanism	In addition, other @DRUG$ have been reported to decrease the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of @DRUG$.
2479	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
2480	DDI-advise	Patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR).
2481	DDI-int	The in vitro interaction between @DRUG$ and the antithrombotic agent @DRUG$ is complex.
2482	DDI-mechanism	The immediate release, but not the coat-core formulation of @DRUG$ increased plasma @DRUG$ concentrations by about 20%.
2483	DDI-effect	In combination with other @DRUG$, @DRUG$ may still kill even experienced users, particularly if their tolerance to the drug has reduced or the strength of their usual dose has increased.
2484	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), @DRUG$ (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2485	DDI-effect	Other CNS depressant drugs (e.g. barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids and general anesthetics) have additive or potentiating effects with @DRUG$.
2486	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, @DRUG$, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2487	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
2488	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ salts may reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and @DRUG$.
2489	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ causes an increase in phenobarbital plasma concentrations, In 12 otherwise healthy male volunteers ingesting phenobarbital, the steady-state trough (Cmin) phenobarbital concentration was 14.2 micrograms/mL.
2490	DDI-effect	Dexamethasone and @DRUG$ similarly inhibit and stimulate @DRUG$- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
2491	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
2492	DDI-effect	Gentamicin - @DRUG$ may protect against the ototoxic effects of @DRUG$.
2493	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2494	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
2495	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
2496	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2497	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of @DRUG$, and a high dose of naloxone (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin (16 micrograms).
2498	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Diclofenac and other @DRUG$ can inhibit the activity of @DRUG$.
2499	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2500	DDI-advise	Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for @DRUG$ when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2501	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), anticholinergics or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
2502	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, @DRUG$, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2503	DDI-advise	Therefore you may need to take a @DRUG$ supplement while taking @DRUG$.
2504	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.
2505	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
2506	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, @DRUG$, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2507	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
2508	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ diminishes the effect of @DRUG$ and warfarin.
2509	DDI-effect	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of @DRUG$ (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by @DRUG$, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
2510	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other diuretics should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2511	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, @DRUG$, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2512	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.
2513	DDI-mechanism	These studies indicate that @DRUG$ or erythromycin co-administration enhances @DRUG$ gastrointestinal absorption.
2514	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, @DRUG$).
2515	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, antihypertensive agents, or other vasodilators.
2516	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, @DRUG$, olprinone and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2517	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
2518	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or @DRUG$ (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
2519	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or @DRUG$ may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
2520	DDI-effect	Additional reductions in blood pressure may occur when @DRUG$ is administered with diuretics, @DRUG$, or other vasodilators.
2521	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;lithium;magnesium salts;procainamide;and @DRUG$."
2522	DDI-advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence @DRUG$ is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium/aluminum-containing @DRUG$.
2523	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, @DRUG$, anesthetics) should be considered.
2524	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2525	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ritonavir, and @DRUG$) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.
2526	DDI-mechanism	Ethosuximide: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$.
2527	DDI-effect	Acetaminophen: A report of severe @DRUG$ toxicity was reported in a patient receiving @DRUG$.
2528	DDI-mechanism	However, the peak plasma level of @DRUG$ was reduced by approximately 20% when taking @DRUG$ due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
2529	DDI-mechanism	The lower rate of absorption in the groups receiving 446 mg @DRUG$ instead of 48 mg of Fe per kg diet resulted in a decreased renal excretion of @DRUG$.
2530	DDI-advise	Consequently, the combination of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ is also contraindicated.
2531	DDI-mechanism	In eight HIV-infected patients, the steady-state AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 26% (95% CI = 14%, 37%) when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours prior to a marketed chewable/dispersible tablet formulation of @DRUG$.
2532	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either @DRUG$ or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
2533	DDI-effect	Among the risk factors studied, two appear to increase the risk of ARE: the prescription of @DRUG$ to treat strongyloidiasis during the @DRUG$ cure and the bad general clinical conditions of patients.
2534	DDI-mechanism	Dicumarol: It has been reported that @DRUG$ prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, @DRUG$.
2535	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
2536	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
2537	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2538	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
2539	DDI-effect	Vaccines: Patients on @DRUG$ therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or @DRUG$ due to inhibition of antibody response.
2540	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either @DRUG$ or PCP in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
2541	DDI-effect	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$) have been rarely reported to cause weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination when coadministered with @DRUG$.
2542	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation.
2543	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
2544	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2545	DDI-advise	Care should be taken if @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with @DRUG$s of the verapamil type.
2546	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple-dose study, @DRUG$ caused a dose-related increase in the mean elimination half-life of @DRUG$, thereby decreasing the clearance of caffeine by up to 80% and leading to a five-fold increase in the AUC and the half-life of caffeine.
2547	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, @DRUG$, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, valproate, astemizole, and lovastatin.
2548	DDI-effect	Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as @DRUG$ or guanethidine, should be closely monitored, because the added beta-adrenergic blocking action of @DRUG$ may produce excessive reduction of sympathetic activity.
2549	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with @DRUG$ and serotonergic agents.
2550	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ have been reported to competitively inhibit @DRUG$ accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.
2551	DDI-effect	Interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in the development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos.
2552	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased @DRUG$ exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar by 2.3 fold.
2553	DDI-effect	Although glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce PROLEUKIN-induced side effects including fever, renal insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, confusion, and dyspnea, concomitant administration of these agents with PROLEUKIN may reduce the antitumor effectiveness of PROLEUKIN and thus should be avoided. 12 Beta-blockers and other @DRUG$ may potentiate the hypotension seen with @DRUG$.
2554	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or @DRUG$.
2555	DDI-int	Digitalis: Immediate Release Capsules: Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
2556	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, @DRUG$ and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
2557	DDI-effect	The effectiveness of @DRUG$-only pills is reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenytoin, carbamazepine, and @DRUG$, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin.
2558	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives @DRUG$: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride

2562	DDI-mechanism	In clinical trials, FLOLAN was used with digoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving @DRUG$ or digoxin in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
2563	DDI-mechanism	Furosemide: When @DRUG$ was co-administered with @DRUG$, the AUC and Cmax of furosemide were reduced by about 30% and 50%, respectively.
2564	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
2565	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
2566	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
2567	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with @DRUG$ therapy.
2568	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of fenofibrate (equivalent to 145mg @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ (40 mg) once daily for 10 days has been shown to increase the mean Cmax and AUC values for pravastatin by 36% (range from 69% decrease to 321% increase) and 28% (range from 54% decrease to 128% increase), respectively, and for 3 -hydroxy-iso-pravastatin by 55% (range from 32% decrease to 314% increase) and 39% (range from 24% decrease to 261% increase), respectively in 23 healthy adults.
2569	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase sensitivity to the @DRUG$.
2570	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2571	DDI-mechanism	Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of digoxin and @DRUG$.
2572	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, astemizole and cisapride are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
2573	DDI-advise	Consequently, @DRUG$ should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and @DRUG$, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A.
2574	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of @DRUG$.
2575	DDI-effect	"@DRUG$ may decrease the hemodynamic effects of @DRUG$;"
2576	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
2577	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as @DRUG$ or tolbutamide from their binding sites.
2578	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
2579	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients on @DRUG$ should be observed when @DRUG$ Tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
2580	DDI-effect	@DRUG$-induced oxidative stress in rat brain and liver is prevented by @DRUG$ or allopurinol.
2581	DDI-mechanism	Methenamine therapy: Urinary excretion of @DRUG$ is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by @DRUG$ used in methenamine therapy.
2582	DDI-effect	- Although not a true drug interaction, @DRUG$ may precipitate seizures in susceptible patients and @DRUG$ dosage may need to be adjusted
2583	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with penicillamine (Depen, @DRUG$), another arthritis medication.
2584	DDI-advise	Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of @DRUG$ with any of the @DRUG$ and also in switching from one class to the other.
2585	DDI-int	A potential interaction between oral @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
2586	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Has a synergistic effect with @DRUG$ in causing gastrointestinal bleeding.
2587	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ reduced or eliminated the increases in FI responding produced by intermediate doses of either (+)-NANM or @DRUG$ in pigeons, but did not antagonize the decreases in FI or FR responding produced by high doses of PCP or either stereoisomer of NANM.
2588	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, and valproic acid with phenobarbital at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.

2670	DDI-effect	Veratrum alkaloids: @DRUG$ inhibit the hypotensive effect of @DRUG$.
2671	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and @DRUG$, and digitalis.
2672	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
2673	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ causes an approximate 50% increase in the clearance of @DRUG$  at steady state and, therefore, the addition of carbamazepine results in an approximate 40% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
2674	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.

2679	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as Imitrex (@DRUG$) and dihydroergotamine.
2680	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
2681	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, @DRUG$, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2682	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine - @DRUG$ may counteract the antinaturetic effect of @DRUG$.
2683	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.

2686	DDI-mechanism	Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$) could cause an increase in @DRUG$ clearance and lower blood levels.
2687	DDI-effect	This allows @DRUG$ to open air passages, increasing the effectiveness of the @DRUG$.
2688	DDI-effect	Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral @DRUG$ (an imidazole) and oral @DRUG$, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out.
2689	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or @DRUG$.

2691	DDI-advise	MAO Inhibitors: @DRUG$  is not recommended for use in patients who have received @DRUG$ within 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics
2692	DDI-advise	For example, when @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.
2693	DDI-effect	Suppression by @DRUG$ of @DRUG$-enhanced peritoneal metastasis of intestinal adenocarcinomas induced by azoxymethane in wistar rats.
2694	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
2695	DDI-effect	Norepinephrine: @DRUG$ enhance the adrenergic effect of @DRUG$.
2696	DDI-advise	In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of @DRUG$ should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
2697	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either @DRUG$ or amantadine concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.

2704	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or @DRUG$ because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
2705	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
2706	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
2707	DDI-effect	Given the primary CNS effects of @DRUG$, caution is advised in using it concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs or @DRUG$.
2708	DDI-effect	In uninfected volunteers, 46% developed rash while receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
2709	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a @DRUG$ or any other psychotropic drug.
2710	DDI-effect	Combinations of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains.
2711	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and @DRUG$-containing preparations.
2712	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing magnesium or @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
2713	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of @DRUG$, especially in the presence of impaired renal function.
2714	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ and norepinephrine.
2715	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), @DRUG$ (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
2716	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may decrease arterial responsiveness to @DRUG$.
2717	DDI-effect	Data suggest that coadministration of oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2718	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, @DRUG$, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2719	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, olprinone and @DRUG$ may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2720	DDI-effect	Anakinra: Concurrent administration of anakinra (an @DRUG$) and another @DRUG$ has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, an increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
2721	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), @DRUG$, zileuton.
2722	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).

2726	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ is known to slow the metabolism of @DRUG$ and increase its serum levels Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made.
2727	DDI-mechanism	MAO inhibitors @DRUG$, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow @DRUG$ metabolism.
2728	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (@DRUG$ such as ranitidine or cimetidine) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
2729	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2730	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ decreases urinary excretion of @DRUG$ and may enhance the magnitude and duration of their effect.
2731	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
2732	DDI-effect	Oral @DRUG$ may be less effective while you are taking @DRUG$.
2733	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other @DRUG$ (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
2734	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$.
2735	DDI-int	A possible drug interaction of @DRUG$ and intravenous @DRUG$ has been described.
2736	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate @DRUG$- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
2737	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, @DRUG$, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
2738	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
2739	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: Flupenthixol may interact with some drugs, like Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI could theoretically affect flupenthixol pharmacodynamics - Arecoline - Eproxindine - Ethanol: @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ cause additive CNS depression - Tricyclic antidepressants: Flupenthixol increases the effect of Tricyclic antidepressants
2740	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, @DRUG$, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
2741	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: When a single 125-mg dose of @DRUG$ was administered on Day5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of @DRUG$, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
2742	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other @DRUG$ have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
2743	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
2744	DDI-effect	Warfarin: Increased INR (International Normalized Ratio) when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were co-administered has been rarely reported.
2745	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ also significantly decreased the incidence of lymphatic invasion of adenocarcinomas, which was enhanced by @DRUG$.
2746	DDI-effect	Renal clearance measurements of @DRUG$ cannot be made with any significant accuracy in patients receiving sulfonamides, @DRUG$, or thiazolesulfone.
2747	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
2748	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
2749	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken within 2 hours of @DRUG$.
2750	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block morphine-induced and @DRUG$-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2751	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and furosemide or other @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained.
2752	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised during the administration of @DRUG$ to patients anaesthetised with @DRUG$ as arrhythmias may be precipitated.
2753	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, @DRUG$, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
2754	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2755	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general @DRUG$, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2756	DDI-mechanism	In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the @DRUG$ was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2757	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ treatment resulted in a 42% decrease in the @DRUG$ AUC 0-24, but no clinically relevant effect was observed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinyl estradiol.
2758	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
2759	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2760	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, @DRUG$, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2761	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with @DRUG$ (40 mg BID for 7 days) resulted in a significant increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels suggesting that, at these doses, valdecoxib is a weak inhibitor of 2D6.
2762	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
2763	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, @DRUG$, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2764	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, if @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$, the clinician should be alert to the possibility of increases in digoxin levels.
2765	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: @DRUG$ Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride

2767	DDI-effect	However, because bleeding has been reported when @DRUG$ and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on @DRUG$, the physician should be cautious when administering ibuprofen to patients on anticoagulants.
2768	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
2769	DDI-mechanism	Co-treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC by 2/3.
2770	DDI-effect	Death due to fulminant pancreatitis possibly related to intravenous @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported.
2771	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
2772	DDI-advise	Caution should be used if @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
2773	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, @DRUG$, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2774	DDI-advise	After stopping @DRUG$ Tablets, at least 2 weeks should be allowed before starting a @DRUG$.
2775	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as @DRUG$, thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
2776	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ protects mouse tumour and normal tissues from the toxicity of oral @DRUG$.
2777	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
2778	DDI-effect	"Both ibogaine and @DRUG$ block @DRUG$-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens;"
2779	DDI-advise	The use of @DRUG$ FOR INJECTION in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended due to the risk of severe pulmonary toxicity.
2780	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
2781	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and @DRUG$.
2782	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal Contraceptives, Including Oral, Injectable, Transdermal, and Implantable Contraceptives: An interaction study demonstrated that co-administration of @DRUG$ and the oral hormonal contraceptive @DRUG$ produced average decreases of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol levels of 14% and 31%, respectively.
2783	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
2784	DDI-effect	Catecholamine-depleting drugs, e.g., @DRUG$, may have an additive effect when given with @DRUG$.
2785	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
2786	DDI-effect	Severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
2787	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other @DRUG$, concomitant administration of Ponstel and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
2788	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2789	DDI-advise	Following the administration of @DRUG$, the dose of other @DRUG$ should be reduced.
2790	DDI-effect	We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of @DRUG$ seen in animals treated with @DRUG$ derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
2791	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other @DRUG$, causing increased CNS depression.
2792	DDI-advise	It is suggested that in patients receiving @DRUG$, alternatives to @DRUG$ should be used if anticonvulsant therapy is needed.
2793	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients receiving Antabuse (@DRUG$, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories).
2794	DDI-effect	When other @DRUG$ or anticoagulants are used concomitantly, there is the potential for @DRUG$ to increase the risk of bleeding.
2795	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 2400 mg/day increased the steadystate @DRUG$ Cmin to 96 25 micrograms/mL.
2796	DDI-advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of @DRUG$ and other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of each other is not recommended.
2797	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ at 10 microM preferentially blocked the secretory effect of @DRUG$ and its synergism with cAMP, whereas it had no effect on histamine- or cAMP-stimulated acid secretion within 15 min.
2798	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with any of the following: - Acetaminophen (e.g., @DRUG$) (with long-term, high-dose use) or

2800	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids: A relationship of functional antagonism exists between @DRUG$ analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and @DRUG$, which inhibit calcium absorption.
2801	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase slightly the effect of antihypertensive drugs, e.g., guanethidine, methyldopa, @DRUG$.
2802	DDI-mechanism	"A number of drugs, including @DRUG$, have been shown to displace @DRUG$ from plasma protein;"

2808	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, @DRUG$, or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
2809	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the zidovudine tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated @DRUG$ by 110%.
2810	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Studies in normal volunteers have shown that @DRUG$ like other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can interfere with the effects of @DRUG$.
2811	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, @DRUG$ or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
2812	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase), resulting in toxicity in some cases.
2813	DDI-effect	Corticosteroids and Corticotropin (@DRUG$): may potentiate @DRUG$- induced hypokalemia which may predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction.
2814	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
2815	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ and ergotamine or @DRUG$ has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.

2817	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, @DRUG$ and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2818	DDI-advise	This time window is different than for other oral formulations of @DRUG$, which are usually administered 2 hours before or 6 hours after @DRUG$.
2819	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, @DRUG$, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
2820	DDI-advise	As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$
2821	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
2822	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements or @DRUG$).
2823	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, @DRUG$, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
2824	DDI-mechanism	During @DRUG$ administration, systemic clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced from 234 +/- 72 ml/min (mean +/- standard deviation) to 172 +/- 33 ml/min (p less than 0.01).
2825	DDI-int	A two-way interaction between the @DRUG$, phenytoin, and the @DRUG$s has been suggested.

2827	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the @DRUG$ salts, and antihistamines.
2828	DDI-mechanism	H2 Receptor Antagonists: @DRUG$ coadministration leads to an increased peak plasma concentration and AUC of @DRUG$, there is no effect on cisapride absorption when it is coadministered with ranitidine.
2829	DDI-advise	@DRUG$: generally should not be given with @DRUG$.
2830	DDI-effect	The effects of medicinal products with similar properties such as inotropes milrinone, enoximone, amrinone, @DRUG$ and cilostazol may be exacerbated by @DRUG$.
2831	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
2832	DDI-effect	The possibility of hypotensive effects with @DRUG$ or enalaprilat can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril or enalaprilat.
2833	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or @DRUG$) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B).
2834	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
2835	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs.
2836	DDI-effect	Central Nervous System Depressants: The concomitant use of @DRUG$  (fentanyl transdermal system) with other central nervous system depressants, including but not limited to other opioids, @DRUG$, hypnotics, tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), general anesthetics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, and alcohol, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, or potentially result in coma or death.
2837	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
2838	DDI-advise	@DRUG$- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
2839	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of rifabutin by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 13.3-fold.
2840	DDI-mechanism	"@DRUG$ (amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
2841	DDI-advise	Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of @DRUG$ should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$ 400 mg daily.
2842	DDI-effect	This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of @DRUG$ toxicity when @DRUG$ is withdrawn.
2843	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered @DRUG$, such as dopamine.
2844	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: @DRUG$  causes a decrease in the steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations and an increase in the steady-state carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration.
2845	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may antagonize the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
2846	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
2847	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by allopurinol and @DRUG$.
2848	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to antiepileptic drugs (@DRUG$) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
2849	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other @DRUG$.
2850	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, @DRUG$ chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
2851	DDI-effect	As with other @DRUG$, it should be noted that HALDOL may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, opiates, and alcohol.
2852	DDI-effect	- Antihypertensives: @DRUG$ may potentiate the effect of various @DRUG$, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.
2853	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
2854	DDI-effect	Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when @DRUG$ is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as @DRUG$, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics.
2855	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other @DRUG$, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
2856	DDI-advise	Although a dose adjustment of @DRUG$ is not recommended when administered in combination with @DRUG$, close monitoring for known side effects of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.
2857	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase slightly the effect of @DRUG$, e.g., guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine.
2858	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
2859	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other @DRUG$.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
2860	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, @DRUG$, oral contraceptives, rifampin, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
2861	DDI-mechanism	Etonogestrel may interact with the following medicaoxin, diuretics, anticoagulants, oral vasodilators, and supplemental oxygen.In a pharmacokinetic substudy in patients with congestive heart failure receiving furosemide or @DRUG$ in whom therapy with @DRUG$ was initiated, apparent oral clearance values for furosemide (n = 23) and digoxin (n = 30) were decreased by 13% and 15%, respectively, on the second day of therapy and had returned to baseline values by day 87.
2862	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ during therapy with a @DRUG$ has been shown to produce a  stimulating  effect in some depressed patients.
2863	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an inhibitor of P450 2C9, decreased active metabolite concentration and increased @DRUG$ concentration.
2864	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the indinavir dose to 1000 mg every 8 hours does not compensate for the increased @DRUG$ metabolism due to @DRUG$.
2865	DDI-effect	Recovery from 50% twitch to 75% fade recovery took 13.8 +/- 0.8 min for atracurium alone and 13.7 +/- 1.2 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
2866	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, @DRUG$, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
2867	DDI-effect	However, because some @DRUG$ have been reported to enhance the effects of @DRUG$ or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a quinolone antimicrobial is administered with warfarin or its derivatives.
2868	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
2869	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
2870	DDI-mechanism	Patients taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of disopyramide resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
2871	DDI-effect	However, high doses of @DRUG$ may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered @DRUG$.
2872	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, @DRUG$, and oral ketoconazole markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
2873	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2874	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
2875	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
2876	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, and @DRUG$ have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
2877	DDI-advise	It is not known if the effects of @DRUG$ are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs (@DRUG$, etc.), but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed.
2878	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, @DRUG$ or warfarin.

2883	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.
2884	DDI-effect	(In some patients, the @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
2885	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
2886	DDI-advise	Patients receiving both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.
2887	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
2888	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, @DRUG$, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
2889	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
2890	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and cyclosporine, tacrolimus or @DRUG$ has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
2891	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, @DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.

2895	DDI-mechanism	Co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased.
2896	DDI-effect	The antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by @DRUG$.
2897	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ Antimycobacterial agents: @DRUG$

2902	DDI-mechanism	The absorption of oral @DRUG$ is significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of an antacid containing aluminum and @DRUG$.
2903	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of @DRUG$ or activated charcoal in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
2904	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone was found to have no effect on CAS, but can completely block @DRUG$-induced phosphorylation of this protein in MDA-MB-435 cells.
2905	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may cause an increased prothrombin response by displacing the @DRUG$ from protein binding sites or a diminished prothrombin response through increased metabolism of the unbound drug by hepatic enzyme induction, thus leading to inter-patient variation in ultimate prothrombin effect.
2906	DDI-effect	Drugs that reduce the number of blood platelets by causing bone marrow depression (such as antineoplastic agents) or drugs which inhibit platelet function (eg, aspirin and other @DRUG$, dipyridamole, hydrochloroquine, clofibrate, dextran) may increase the bleeding tendency produced by @DRUG$ without altering prothrombin time determinations.

2973	DDI-mechanism	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$.
2974	DDI-effect	Patients in a clinical study who were on established therapy with @DRUG$, to which @DRUG$ was added, were noted to develop a mild decrease in mean neutrophil counts in comparison to groups treated with either ENBREL CI or sulfasalazine alone.
2975	DDI-mechanism	"Phenytoin: @DRUG$ may delay intestinal absorption of @DRUG$;"

3009	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3010	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, @DRUG$, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered

3049	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate Lodine, like other @DRUG$, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
3050	DDI-mechanism	Salicylic acid: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
3051	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of ciprofloxacin was decreased an average of 15-fold in 12 healthy subjects given @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-placebo tablets concurrently.
3052	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
3053	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3054	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ capsules and @DRUG$ resulted in substantial increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene, probably at least partially related to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition by gemfibrozil.

3058	DDI-effect	Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or @DRUG$ (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of @DRUG$.
3059	DDI-effect	Thioridazine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
3060	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and D.H.E. 45  (@DRUG$) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
3061	DDI-mechanism	When intravenous morphine and BREVIBLOC were concomitantly administered in normal subjects, no effect on morphine blood levels was seen, but @DRUG$ steady-state blood levels were increased by 46% in the presence of @DRUG$.
3062	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, @DRUG$, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.

3066	DDI-effect	It is possible that the cardiovascular action of other @DRUG$ could be enhanced by the addition of @DRUG$ .
3067	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3068	DDI-effect	Taking @DRUG$ after drinking @DRUG$ may worsen side effects and may cause severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.
3069	DDI-mechanism	ERYTHROMYCIN: In hypercholesterolemic patients, steady-state @DRUG$ AUC and Cmax increased approximately 50% and 24% respectively after 10 days with co-administration of @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
3070	DDI-mechanism	Because @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of @DRUG$, simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided.
3071	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as @DRUG$, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3072	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as quinidine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
3073	DDI-mechanism	Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: @DRUG$ may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain @DRUG$, thereby increasing their effect.
3074	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3075	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of @DRUG$ (300 m g/mL), the binding of @DRUG$ was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels.

3078	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of trovafloxacin and @DRUG$ when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3079	DDI-effect	Aspirin: Animal studies wshow that @DRUG$ given with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including @DRUG$, yields a net decrease in anti-inflammatory activity with lowered blood levels of the non-aspirin drug.
3080	DDI-effect	There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ were co-administered.
3081	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other..
3082	DDI-advise	However, because bleeding has been reported when ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been administered to patients on coumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients on @DRUG$.
3083	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3084	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, @DRUG$), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3085	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (@DRUG$), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3086	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of @DRUG$, phenytoin and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients.
3087	DDI-mechanism	Therefore, @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, @DRUG$ salts and digoxin).
3088	DDI-mechanism	Hormonal contraceptives Co-administration of @DRUG$ with an oral @DRUG$ has been shown to influence the plasma concentrations of the two hormonal components, ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG).
3089	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, @DRUG$ such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3090	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3091	DDI-effect	Injection: @DRUG$ injection, like other injectable benzodiazepines, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with @DRUG$, phenothiazines, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
3092	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the @DRUG$ and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3093	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ alone had no effect on platelet aggregation, but did slightly enhance the inhibition of platelet aggregation by @DRUG$.
3094	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when @DRUG$ is used with other anticholinergic drugs or @DRUG$.
3095	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of @DRUG$, sulfinpyrazone, and phenylbutazone.
3096	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ is given to patients receiving @DRUG$, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
3097	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels.
3098	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, @DRUG$, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3099	DDI-effect	Nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or potent diuretics such as furosemide.
3100	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3101	DDI-mechanism	"In a ten-subject study, coadministration of @DRUG$ (120 mg bid) with @DRUG$ resulted in a 3-4 times increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax vs. lovastatin alone;"
3102	DDI-mechanism	Acid-catalyzed ethanolysis of @DRUG$ in anhydrous and aqueous @DRUG$ solutions.
3103	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, @DRUG$, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3104	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3105	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3106	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, @DRUG$, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3107	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like @DRUG$ or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3108	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3109	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as ketoconazole, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
3110	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, vaiproic acid, and sodium valproate.
3111	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (@DRUG$) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
3112	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, @DRUG$), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a @DRUG$ (eg, amitriptyline)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3113	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant oral administration of @DRUG$ (a known inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral @DRUG$.
3114	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in @DRUG$metabolism.
3115	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, @DRUG$, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3116	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3117	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ had no significant impact on the Cmax and AUC of zidovudine, although it significantly decreased the @DRUG$ tmax by 44% and increased the intracellular exposure to phosphorylated zidovudine by 110%.
3118	DDI-effect	Toxicology studies of @DRUG$-related deaths reveal frequent involvement of other central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), and, to a rising degree, @DRUG$.
3119	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir and indinavir: Upon concomitant administration of 5 mg of @DRUG$ with 600 mg BID @DRUG$, the Cmax and AUC of ritonavir were reduced by approximately 20%.
3120	DDI-advise	Alcohol - Although LEXAPRO did not potentiate the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic medications, the use of @DRUG$ by patients taking @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3121	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ and to potentiate its toxicity.
3122	DDI-effect	- Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and @DRUG$.
3123	DDI-effect	Although neither dexamethasone nor @DRUG$ affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
3124	DDI-mechanism	Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine: @DRUG$ increases the plasma levels of the following agents: Clomipramine HCl, @DRUG$(6), and primidone Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with EQUETROTM, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary.
3125	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, @DRUG$ (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3126	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, @DRUG$ or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3127	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
3128	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ as compared to a non-matched historicalcontrol group resulted in a 30%, 27%, and 25% decrease in serum amprenavir AUC, Cmax, andCmin, respectively.
3129	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone) .
3130	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3131	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3132	DDI-advise	Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage are required when @DRUG$ is administered with anticholinergic or @DRUG$.
3133	DDI-effect	The use of @DRUG$ may result in additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with @DRUG$, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3134	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
3135	DDI-advise	Hypersensitivity Reactions: Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing Cremophor  EL (eg, @DRUG$ for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be treated with @DRUG$.
3136	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3137	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, @DRUG$ or other sedatives.
3138	DDI-effect	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of @DRUG$ needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or Innovar than with pentobarbital.
3139	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem and @DRUG$ with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
3140	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some @DRUG$), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3141	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and @DRUG$ may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3142	DDI-effect	The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is unknown, and the concomitant use of two potentially hepatotoxic medications is not ordinarily recommended unless the probable benefits outweigh the known risks.
3143	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., @DRUG$, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3144	DDI-advise	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants: @DRUG$ should be administered with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ or tricyclic antidepressants because the action of formoterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
3145	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
3146	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, @DRUG$, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3147	DDI-mechanism	or with multivitamins containing @DRUG$ may substantially interfere with drug absorption and result in insufficient plasma and tissue @DRUG$ concentrations.
3148	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an @DRUG$ (eg, chlorpromazine), an antiparkinsonian drug (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3149	DDI-effect	Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using @DRUG$ or digitalis concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3150	DDI-mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when @DRUG$ was administered 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3151	DDI-effect	Since @DRUG$ inhibits platelet function, there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients maintained on @DRUG$.
3152	DDI-advise	@DRUG$-containing therapies should not be used with @DRUG$ as they may diminish its pharmacologic action.
3153	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
3154	DDI-advise	Special consideration should be given to the administration of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ or other drugs that could cause or potentiate hypotension.
3155	DDI-effect	The vasodilating effects of @DRUG$ may be additive with those of other @DRUG$.
3156	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
3157	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (@DRUG$);"
3158	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
3159	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
3160	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., @DRUG$), should be approached with caution.
3161	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, @DRUG$.
3162	DDI-effect	The hypotensive effect of @DRUG$ is augmented by that of most other hypotensive drugs, including @DRUG$, negative inotropic agents, and inhaled anesthetics.
3163	DDI-effect	Since @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, including MIDAMOR, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.
3164	DDI-effect	Diuretics: Patients on @DRUG$, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$.
3165	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for norethindrone and @DRUG$.
3166	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
3167	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
3168	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ is to be combined with other psychotropic agents such as tranquilizers or sedative/@DRUG$, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents employed since the sedative effects of desipramine and benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide or diazepam) are additive.
3169	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and @DRUG$ in some patients.
3170	DDI-mechanism	Macrolide Antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and troleandomycin): Agents of the @DRUG$, of which D.H.E. 45  (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a member, have been shown to interact with antibiotics of the @DRUG$, resulting in increased plasma levels of unchanged alkaloids and peripheral vasoconstriction.
3171	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
3172	DDI-mechanism	Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the @DRUG$ have been reported upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant 6.
3173	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may enhance the effects of @DRUG$.
3174	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other @DRUG$ likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3175	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is withdrawn from the combination therapy, @DRUG$ dose should then be reduced.
3176	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: After introduction of @DRUG$ (oral form), a sudden increase in serum @DRUG$ level has been reported.
3177	DDI-effect	A rare, but serious, constellation of symptoms, termed serotonin syndrome, has been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ (SSRIs) and agents for migraine therapy, such as @DRUG$ (sumatriptan succinate) and dihydroergotamine.
3178	DDI-int	In addition to bleeding associated with heparin and vitamin K antagonists, drugs that alter platelet function (such as @DRUG$, dipyridamole and Abciximab) may increase the risk of bleeding if administered prior to, during, or after @DRUG$ therapy.
3179	DDI-effect	@DRUG$: Concomitant administration with @DRUG$ may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and may reduce serum salicylate levels.
3180	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
3181	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, @DRUG$, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3182	DDI-effect	The incidence of akathisia in clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule was greater (8.5%, 4/47 patients) when @DRUG$ was administered on the same day as @DRUG$ than when these drugs were given on separate days (1.3%, 1/80 patients).
3183	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3184	DDI-mechanism	Naproxen, @DRUG$ and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.
3185	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3186	DDI-effect	Imipramine: Coadministration of single doses of @DRUG$ 20 mg and @DRUG$ 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration.
3187	DDI-mechanism	Although concomitant use of Clozapine and carbamazepine is not recommended, it should be noted that discontinuation of concomitant @DRUG$ administration may result in an increase in @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3188	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with dicumarol or @DRUG$, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3189	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ dose should not exceed a maximum of 25 mg in a 48- hour period in patients receiving concomitant @DRUG$ therapy.
3190	DDI-effect	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.
3191	DDI-effect	The mean QT c interval (msec) was 369 with terfenadine alone and 367 with @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$.
3192	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ was poorly tolerated, and 5 of 11 subjects discontinued therapy.
3193	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, @DRUG$, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
3194	DDI-effect	We conclude that @DRUG$ prevents @DRUG$-induced increases in gastrointestinal transit time by means of selective peripheral opioid anitagonism without affecting central opioid analgesia.
3195	DDI-effect	Coumarin Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ such as warfarin and phenprocoumon.
3196	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3197	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ (another TNF -blocking agent) and @DRUG$ (an interleukin-1 antagonist) has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and increased risk of neutropenia and no additional benefit compared to these medicinal products alone.
3198	DDI-effect	In ewes given 40 mg of @DRUG$/kg for 5 days intraperitoneally (IP), the anticholinesterase effect of 4 mg of @DRUG$/kg was significantly reduced and signs of toxicity were not present.
3199	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, @DRUG$, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3200	DDI-effect	Levodopa and Amantadine: Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse experiences in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with either levodopa or @DRUG$.
3201	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$: Decreases @DRUG$ effectiveness by enzyme induction.
3202	DDI-effect	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
3203	DDI-mechanism	Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 38% and 45%, respectively, when @DRUG$ was given with @DRUG$.
3204	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3205	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, @DRUG$, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3206	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ AUC values by 14%.
3207	DDI-effect	- Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by @DRUG$ include: anticoagulants, corticosteroids, coumarin, digitoxin, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, @DRUG$, quinidine, theophylline, vitamin D.
3208	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [@DRUG$], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3209	DDI-mechanism	however, 150 mg of @DRUG$ q12h for 3 days increased the ceftibuten C max by 23% and @DRUG$ AUC by 16%.
3210	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
3211	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
3212	DDI-advise	However, prudent medical practice dictates careful monitoring of prothrombin time in all patients treated with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly.
3213	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may not be effective due to decreased @DRUG$ concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly.
3214	DDI-mechanism	"Oral contraceptives: @DRUG$, when given once daily for 14 days as a 100-mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of @DRUG$, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43%, and decreased the AUC of norethindrone by 8%;"
3215	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if @DRUG$ and/or narcotics are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
3216	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
3217	DDI-mechanism	Metoclopramide: Bioavailability is mildly reduced (approximately 10%) when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3218	DDI-effect	Butalbital, @DRUG$ and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other narcotic analgesics, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3219	DDI-effect	Moreover, as noted with @DRUG$, the effect of @DRUG$ may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses.
3220	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3221	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, @DRUG$, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3222	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate Renal tubular transport of @DRUG$ may be inhibited by concomitant administration of @DRUG$, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate.
3223	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
3224	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, @DRUG$, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
3225	DDI-effect	Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., @DRUG$, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of @DRUG$.
3226	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either terbinafine, @DRUG$, or cisapride.
3227	DDI-advise	If treatment with inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (such as @DRUG$, intraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, etc.) is indicated, reduction of the @DRUG$ dose should be considered.
3228	DDI-effect	Coingestion of acetaminophen with theophylline, phenobarbital with acetaminophen, and @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ at high to toxic concentrations decreases the binding of the target drug.
3229	DDI-mechanism	In vitro, @DRUG$ may displace less firmly bound drugs like @DRUG$.
3230	DDI-effect	Recovery of hoof twitch from 50% to 75% took 7.7 +/- 0.7 min for atracurium alone and 11.5 +/- 2.7 min for @DRUG$ plus @DRUG$ (P = 0.03).
3231	DDI-effect	Anticholinergic agents: Although @DRUG$ is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used @DRUG$.
3232	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ are a major contributing factor to @DRUG$ toxicity.
3233	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of @DRUG$ leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
3234	DDI-advise	Patients stabilized on oral @DRUG$ who are found to require @DRUG$ replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started.
3235	DDI-effect	Isoflurane or enflurane administered with @DRUG$/oxygen to achieve 1.25 MAC [Minimum Alveolar Concentration] may prolong the clinically effective duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of NIMBEX and decrease the required infusion rate of @DRUG$.
3236	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, @DRUG$ and progestins, and digitalis.
3237	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as @DRUG$ and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
3238	DDI-effect	Digitalis: @DRUG$ may potentiate the toxic effects of @DRUG$.
3239	DDI-effect	"Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ include: enflurane;isoflurane;halothane;certain antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins;@DRUG$;magnesium salts;procainamide;and quinidine."
3240	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
3241	DDI-effect	Dose-response curves (derived from the results of using the tablets as well as pure powders) showed that @DRUG$ was responsible for the inhibitory activity, which was partially antagonized by @DRUG$.
3242	DDI-advise	Accordingly, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3243	DDI-mechanism	Acetaminophen: In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen.
3244	DDI-mechanism	Inducers and Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism: @DRUG$ reduced plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ by about 70%.
3245	DDI-int	A pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients.
3246	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
3247	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using @DRUG$ or who may need to use short-acting nitrates, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
3248	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
3249	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
3250	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and @DRUG$.
3251	DDI-advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3252	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
3253	DDI-mechanism	Plasma exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was increased 62% when coadministered with fluconazole and 38% when coadministered with @DRUG$.
3254	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., @DRUG$, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
3255	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
3256	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other statins that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as @DRUG$ and atorvastatin.
3257	DDI-effect	Stavudine and Zidovudine @DRUG$ can antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of @DRUG$ and zidovudine against HIV.
3258	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as troleandomycin and @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
3259	DDI-advise	If a patient requires @DRUG$ and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to @DRUG$, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN.
3260	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol and other @DRUG$.
3261	DDI-effect	There is one reported case of a patient with acute delirium associated with the simultaneous use of @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$.
3262	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, acetaminophen and caffeine may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
3263	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, @DRUG$, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3264	DDI-effect	If @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.
3265	DDI-effect	Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: @DRUG$ attenuates potassium loss caused by @DRUG$.
3266	DDI-effect	Stavudine and Zidovudine @DRUG$ can antagonize the in vitro antiviral activity of stavudine and @DRUG$ against HIV.
3267	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when beginning, discontinuing, or changing the dose of @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3268	DDI-advise	Accordingly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not ordinarily be co-administered.
3269	DDI-effect	In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of @DRUG$-related toxicity when given supplemental @DRUG$ at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day.
3270	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, @DRUG$, netilmicin, or tobramycin.
3271	DDI-effect	Anticoagulants including coumarin derivatives, indandione derivatives, and platelet aggregation inhibitors such as @DRUG$ (NSAIDs), and aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3272	DDI-effect	Other @DRUG$ that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis have been shown to interfere with @DRUG$ in some studies and with potassium-sparing diuretics.
3273	DDI-effect	These results suggest that both @DRUG$ and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of @DRUG$ and EGF.
3274	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, co-administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
3275	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
3276	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as @DRUG$, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3277	DDI-effect	poor metabolizers of debrisoquin: Interactions of carvedilol with strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (such as @DRUG$, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of @DRUG$ .
3278	DDI-advise	It is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used concomitantly with @DRUG$ Because the effects of concomitant administration of buspirone HCl with most other psychotropic drugs have not been studied, the concomitant use of buspirone HCl with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with caution.
3279	DDI-mechanism	Warfarin: Quinolones, including @DRUG$, decrease the clearance of @DRUG$, the less active isomer of racemic warfarin.
3280	DDI-mechanism	Alkalinizing agents: Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (@DRUG$, etc.) increase absorption of @DRUG$.
3281	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central anticholinergic syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, @DRUG$, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and antihistamines.
3282	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3283	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3284	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of a @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium- sparing and @DRUG$.
3285	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants, most notably @DRUG$, and MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) is reduced by concomitant administration of N 2O.
3286	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with serotoninergic agents (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
3287	DDI-effect	Vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of @DRUG$-containing drugs when co-administered with these @DRUG$.
3288	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3289	DDI-effect	It has been reported that @DRUG$ enhances the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
3290	DDI-mechanism	Population pharmacokinetic studies showed higher concentrations of @DRUG$ among patients concurrently treated with @DRUG$, an inhibitor of C.P.A..
3291	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, @DRUG$, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3292	DDI-mechanism	Total body clearance of @DRUG$ was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when @DRUG$ and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids.
3293	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, @DRUG$, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3294	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may have additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants, e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, @DRUG$.
3295	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
3296	DDI-effect	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of digoxin and methotrexate and increase @DRUG$ s nephrotoxicity.
3297	DDI-mechanism	However, co  administration of @DRUG$ with either @DRUG$ or erythromycin led to increased plasma concentrations of fexofenadine.
3298	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as @DRUG$ and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
3299	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, @DRUG$, may decrease the hypotensive effects of @DRUG$.
3300	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$- and aluminum-containing antacids, administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, significantly decreased the bioavailability (48%) of lomefloxacin.
3301	DDI-advise	Magnesium: @DRUG$-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3302	DDI-effect	The pressor effects of catecholamines such as @DRUG$ or norepinephrine are enhanced by @DRUG$.
3303	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of @DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$ and resulted in an approximate 80% increase in the AUC for loracarbef.
3304	DDI-effect	Vasopressors: @DRUG$ increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and @DRUG$.
3305	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with @DRUG$ (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3306	DDI-mechanism	"Although no clinical studies have been conducted, it is likely that the metabolism of @DRUG$ may be affected by the known CYP3A4 inducers (such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$), CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antimycotics e.g., ketoconazole;"
3307	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
3308	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, @DRUG$ esters, iron salts, digoxin).
3309	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other @DRUG$ or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3310	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, @DRUG$ elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3311	DDI-advise	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3312	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3313	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, @DRUG$, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3314	DDI-advise	Particular caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., cyclosporine or @DRUG$).
3315	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, @DRUG$, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
3316	DDI-advise	Thus, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
3317	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3318	DDI-effect	The concurrent use of two or more drugs with anticholinergic activity--such as an antipsychotic drug (eg, chlorpromazine), an @DRUG$ (eg, trihexyphenidyl), and/or a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, @DRUG$)--commonly results in excessive anticholinergic effects, including dry mouth and associated dental complications, blurred vision, and, in patients exposed to high temperature and humidity, hyperpyrexia.
3319	DDI-effect	Organic nitrates - @DRUG$ supplements theoretically may potentiate the effects of organic @DRUG$ if taken concomitantly.
3320	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly increased the area under the curve at steady state (AUC(ss)) of @DRUG$ by 2.93-fold and the AUC(ss) of 25-O-desacetylrifabutin by 13.3-fold.
3321	DDI-effect	Drug Interactions: The central @DRUG$ syndrome can occur when anticholinergic agents such as AKINETON are administered concomitantly with drugs that have secondary anticholinergic actions, e.g., certain narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, the phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, certain antiarrhythmics such as the quinidine salts, and @DRUG$.
3322	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of @DRUG$ or sympathomimetic agents;"
3323	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished binding of @DRUG$ by a net change of 9.9% (percentage increase in FDF, 21.2%) at 1732 micromol/L.
3324	DDI-mechanism	The plasma concentration of @DRUG$ may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine may therefore be necessary.
3325	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride.
3326	DDI-effect	Administration of @DRUG$ to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics such as @DRUG$ which sensitize the myocardium, may induce cardiac arrhythmia..
3327	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in anaesthetised horses.

3329	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrated that the potent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducer @DRUG$ did indeed have a marked effect on the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in a 5-fold increase in clearance when administered concomitantly to patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.
3330	DDI-advise	Simultaneous administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should be avoided.
3331	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of metamizol (only in the tail-flick test) and @DRUG$.
3332	DDI-effect	Additionally, anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and @DRUG$, may antagonize the activity of @DRUG$.
3333	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3334	DDI-mechanism	Products containing @DRUG$ and other multivalent cations likely will interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
3335	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [@DRUG$] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
3336	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with @DRUG$ and magnesium containing antacids.
3337	DDI-effect	There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrulation, and torsades de pointes, most like due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin.
3338	DDI-effect	Combined treatment with @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ enhances the degree of apoptosis assessed using morphological markers that identify chromatin and nuclear matrix protein condensation.
3339	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen.
3340	DDI-effect	Similarly, @DRUG$ decreased the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ (only in the tail-flick test) and indomethacin.
3341	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3342	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ should be administered (with food) one hour after or more than two hours before @DRUG$.
3343	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: In controlled studies in healthy volunteers, @DRUG$ either had no effect (one study) or was associated with modest increases, about 30% (two studies) in steady-state serum @DRUG$ concentrations.
3344	DDI-effect	"Drugs that reportedly may increase oral @DRUG$ response, ie, increased prothrombin response, in man include:@DRUG$*;"
3345	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, @DRUG$, etc).
3346	DDI-advise	The use of antacids should be considered in place of H2 blockers or @DRUG$ in patients receiving @DRUG$ therapy.
3347	DDI-effect	However, @DRUG$ has the potential to increase the hypotensive effect of vasodilators and @DRUG$.
3348	DDI-mechanism	Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of @DRUG$ prior to ( 72 hours) or concurrent with @DRUG$ may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.
3349	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, @DRUG$ (AVONEX  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
3350	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., @DRUG$, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers.)
3351	DDI-advise	"for adult-onset diabetics, dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary during and after @DRUG$ therapy;"
3352	DDI-mechanism	HIV Protease Inhibitors: @DRUG$ (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with @DRUG$ 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil Cmax and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life.

3420	DDI-mechanism	In a multiple dose study of @DRUG$ (400 mg once daily for 3 days) and @DRUG$ (20 mg once daily for 3 days), a 16% decrease in the clearance of cetirizine was observed.
3421	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and Anticoagulants: Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3422	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3423	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may antagonize the effects of the drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility, such as @DRUG$.
3424	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3425	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.)
3426	DDI-advise	It is suggested to monitor both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3427	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
3428	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, @DRUG$, propafenone, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3429	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3430	DDI-mechanism	Valproate: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ concentrations.
3431	DDI-mechanism	Single doses of either cholestyramine or @DRUG$ resins bind the @DRUG$ and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.
3432	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3433	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some benzodiazepines (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, @DRUG$, temazepam).
3434	DDI-advise	Therefore, use of @DRUG$ in combination with @DRUG$ is not recommended
3435	DDI-advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ in a 24-hour period when used in combination with @DRUG$.
3436	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
3437	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), @DRUG$ (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3438	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with @DRUG$ and/or cisplatin.1
3439	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of R-warfarin and @DRUG$ (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3440	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
3441	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: @DRUG$ may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, leading to increased plasma concentrations.
3442	DDI-mechanism	Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The drug interaction study evaluating the effect of grepafloxacin on theophylline indicates that @DRUG$ inhibits @DRUG$ metabolism, which is mediated by CYP1A2.
3443	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, @DRUG$, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3444	DDI-advise	Dose reduction of @DRUG$ to 600 mg every 8 hours should be considered when taking @DRUG$ 400 mg three times a day.
3445	DDI-mechanism	However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of @DRUG$ (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant @DRUG$ (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
3446	DDI-advise	Physicians are provided this information to increase awareness of the potential for serious interactions when @DRUG$ and certain @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3447	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to rachitic chicks was effective in significantly elevating duodenal @DRUG$ absorption, acting primarily to enhance serosal transport.
3448	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease @DRUG$ metabolism and increase gefitinib plasma concentrations.
3449	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine
3450	DDI-advise	Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or @DRUG$ (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and @DRUG$ within 24 hours is contraindicated.
3451	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ may reduce the excretion of @DRUG$.
3452	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ generally should not be given with @DRUG$ because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3453	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic citalopram (@DRUG$), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3454	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline @DRUG$, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3455	DDI-mechanism	Interactions of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in absorption and retention.
3456	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, @DRUG$(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3457	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3458	DDI-int	Interactions may occur between @DRUG$ supplements and aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbs such as garlic (Allium sativum) and ginkgo (@DRUG$).
3459	DDI-int	Diphenoxylate HCl and @DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
3460	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, @DRUG$, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3461	DDI-advise	Drugs Whose Absorption Can Be Affected by the Level of Acidity in the Stomach: Drugs such as @DRUG$ and itraconazole should be administered at least 2 hours prior to dosing with @DRUG$.
3462	DDI-advise	however, it adversely affected response duration suggesting that @DRUG$ should not be administered with HEXALEN and/or @DRUG$.1
3463	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: The oral combination of @DRUG$ before intramuscular injection of @DRUG$ produces an increase in piperacillin peak serum level of about 30%.
3464	DDI-advise	As a consequence, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are given concomitantly, the patient should be carefully observed for signs of lithium toxicity.
3465	DDI-advise	Patients already stabilized on @DRUG$ should be closely monitored for loss of symptom control with @DRUG$ coadministration.
3466	DDI-mechanism	Fluconazole: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ at 200 mg QD resulted in a two-fold increase in @DRUG$ plasma concentration.
3467	DDI-mechanism	Ritonavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 152% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and very little change in ritonavir plasma A.C.
3468	DDI-advise	If you are also using a @DRUG$ inhaler, take @DRUG$ first and then wait about 15 minutes before using the steroid inhaler.
3469	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect @DRUG$ concentrations adversely.
3470	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3471	DDI-int	Treatment with @DRUG$ can directly interfere with blood glucose levels or may interact with @DRUG$.
3472	DDI-advise	Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3473	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3474	DDI-mechanism	This small decrease in excretion of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ is not expected to be of clinical importance.
3475	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3476	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease serum @DRUG$ concentration, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, by increasing the non-renal clearance of digoxin.
3477	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3478	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combined use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ should generally be avoided.
3479	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, @DRUG$, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3480	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
3481	DDI-advise	Patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concomitantly should have a dose reduction of azathioprine, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose.
3482	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. @DRUG$, ampicillin esters, iron salts, digoxin).
3483	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: In healthy subjects receiving the CYP3A4 inducer, @DRUG$, at 100 mg twice daily for 3 days and 200 mg twice daily for 17 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to @DRUG$ was decreased approximately 72%.
3484	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3485	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3486	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, @DRUG$, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3487	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3488	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
3489	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (@DRUG$), and vitamin C.
3490	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3491	DDI-mechanism	This increase is due to the inhibition of @DRUG$ metabolism via P450 2C9 by @DRUG$ (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Pharmacokinetics: Metabolism).
3492	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3493	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, @DRUG$, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3494	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, @DRUG$, dicumarol, disulfiram, estrogens, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
3495	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, @DRUG$, and erythromycin may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
3496	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, @DRUG$, indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3497	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of phenytoin or @DRUG$ will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3498	DDI-mechanism	Mercaptopurine/Azathioprine: @DRUG$ inhibits the enzymatic oxidation of @DRUG$ and azathioprine to 6-thiouric acid.
3499	DDI-mechanism	Antacids (aluminum- or magnesium-containing): Concomitant administration of 300-mg @DRUG$ capsules with 30 mL @DRUG$ suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%.
3500	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3501	DDI-mechanism	Presumably, @DRUG$ acts as a stimulator of @DRUG$ metabolism and has been reported to cause decreased serum levels of the coumarin anticoagulants and increased prothrombin-proconvertin concentrations.
3502	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, @DRUG$, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3503	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
3504	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ concentrations may be decreased in the presence of @DRUG$.
3505	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, @DRUG$, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
3506	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3507	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, @DRUG$, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3508	DDI-mechanism	Caffeine Theobromine @DRUG$, like other quinolones, may inhibit the metabolism of caffeine and @DRUG$.
3509	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, @DRUG$, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3510	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
3511	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, @DRUG$, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3512	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain @DRUG$ (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3513	DDI-int	Other drugs Drug interactions have been reported with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and other medications, including cyclosporine, hexobarbital, carbamazepine, alfentanil, disopyramide, phenytoin, bromocriptine, @DRUG$, astemizole, and lovastatin.
3514	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration with compounds that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, phenobarbital, phenytoin, dexamethasone, @DRUG$) may result in decreased plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3515	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, @DRUG$), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3516	DDI-advise	Co-administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ or other agents interfering with neuromuscular transmission (e.g., curare-like compounds) should only be performed with caution as the effect of the toxin may be potentiated.
3517	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, granisetron, @DRUG$, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .
3518	DDI-advise	Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ tablets is therefore contraindicated.
3519	DDI-mechanism	RESULTS: During treatment with @DRUG$, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of @DRUG$, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d.
3520	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, @DRUG$, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3521	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3522	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, @DRUG$, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3523	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, @DRUG$, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3524	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, @DRUG$, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3525	DDI-advise	When used concomitantly, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be titrated carefully.
3526	DDI-advise	It is recommended that if @DRUG$ is started in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants, prothrombin times should be closely monitored and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary.
3527	DDI-int	Therefore, @DRUG$ has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and @DRUG$.
3528	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3529	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, @DRUG$, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
3530	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used together with @DRUG$ (Depen, Cuprimine), another arthritis medication.
3531	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ is contraindicated in patients using long-acting nitrates or who may need to use @DRUG$, because the combination may cause a sharp fall of the blood pressure.
3532	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other @DRUG$.
3533	DDI-mechanism	Promethazine: Coadministration of a single dose of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ (10 and 25 mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of zaleplon, but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
3534	DDI-mechanism	The clearance of @DRUG$ may be increased with concurrent use of @DRUG$.
3535	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, @DRUG$ (TAO), and voriconazole .
3536	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: @DRUG$ metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
3537	DDI-advise	Careful observation is required when @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
3538	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3539	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, @DRUG$, and warfarin.
3540	DDI-mechanism	This small decrease in excretion of @DRUG$ by @DRUG$ is not expected to be of clinical importance.
3541	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, @DRUG$, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3542	DDI-advise	Concomitant Administration with Racemic Citalopram Citalopram - Since @DRUG$ is the active isomer of racemic @DRUG$ (Celexa), the two agents should not be coadministered.
3543	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3544	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, @DRUG$, itraconazole, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
3545	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: @DRUG$ and colestipol resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
3546	DDI-advise	The IV @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
3547	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of @DRUG$ bioavailability.
3548	DDI-advise	Because moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$) result in 2-fold increase in plasma concentrations of @DRUG$, concomitant administration should also be approached with caution.
3549	DDI-advise	Caution is therefore advised when administering @DRUG$ to patients receiving @DRUG$.
3550	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, @DRUG$, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3551	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, @DRUG$, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3552	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3553	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with @DRUG$ for the following: sertraline and @DRUG$.
3554	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease @DRUG$ concentrations.
3555	DDI-mechanism	When the @DRUG$ was administered 30 minutes after the @DRUG$ nasal spray, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and Cmax decreased 18%.
3556	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma @DRUG$ levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance.
3557	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, @DRUG$, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3558	DDI-mechanism	Previous studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in the oral bioavailability of @DRUG$ and ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with an intravenous @DRUG$ such as morphine.
3559	DDI-advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their @DRUG$ dosage when @DRUG$ is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
3560	DDI-advise	Thus patients receiving oral @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ Tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.
3561	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, @DRUG$) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3562	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, @DRUG$ salts, digoxin).
3563	DDI-advise	Therefore, the combination of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not recommended.
3564	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by @DRUG$.
3565	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution, if at all, when potent inhalational anesthetics such as @DRUG$ are employed because of potential to sensitize the myocardium to effects of sympathomimetic amines.
3566	DDI-mechanism	Antifungals: In vitro and/or in vivo data indicate that fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral @DRUG$ markedly inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3567	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ agents decrease blood levels and increase excretion of @DRUG$.
3568	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3569	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and @DRUG$.
3570	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, @DRUG$, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3571	DDI-mechanism	It is known that CYP1A2 is inhibited by several medicinal products, including @DRUG$, and such medicinal products could theoretically adversely influence the clearance of @DRUG$.
3572	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and @DRUG$ was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"
3573	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., @DRUG$, glycosides) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
3574	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
3575	DDI-mechanism	"Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$): Metabolism may be inhibited by @DRUG$, increasing plasma levels of antidepressant;"
3576	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.
3577	DDI-advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$.
3578	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, co-administration of probenecid with @DRUG$ resulted in an increase in the plasma exposure of cefditoren, with a 49% increase in mean Cmax, a 122% increase in mean AUC, and a 53% increase in half-life.
3579	DDI-mechanism	The increase of @DRUG$ level, however, is small (15%) when given with @DRUG$.
3580	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3581	DDI-mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concurrent administration of a quinolone, including @DRUG$, with multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium or aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, @DRUG$, or zinc may substantially decrease the absorption of ciprofloxacin, resulting in serum and urine levels considerably lower than desired.
3582	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: @DRUG$, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3583	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, @DRUG$, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3584	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is inhibited by @DRUG$.
3585	DDI-advise	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and agents (e.g., antipsychotics, other antidepressants, @DRUG$, systemic steroids, etc.) that lower seizure threshold should be undertaken only with extreme caution.
3586	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing @DRUG$ (iron), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
3587	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with @DRUG$, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI.
3588	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, @DRUG$), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3589	DDI-mechanism	The gastrointestinal absorption of cimetidine and @DRUG$ is accelerated when they are coadministered with @DRUG$.
3590	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ concentrations in bile and cystic fluid were increased (about 2-fold) in hydatid cyst patients treated with @DRUG$ (10 mg/kg/day) (n=7) compared with albendazole (20 mg/kg/day) alone (n=12).
3591	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing @DRUG$, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.
3592	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ treatment should be stopped during treatment with @DRUG$.
3593	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, @DRUG$, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3594	DDI-mechanism	After multiple dosing, interferon beta-1a (@DRUG$  30 mcg IM once weekly) reduced @DRUG$  clearance by approximately 30%.
3595	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: Reports indicate that @DRUG$ levels may be increased during concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ for injection.
3596	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (@DRUG$), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"

3598	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3599	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%.
3600	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3601	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be withdrawn at least 48 hours before conducting an @DRUG$-mediated stress test.
3602	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent administration of HEXALEN and antidepressants of the MAO inhibitor class may cause severe orthostatic hypotension.@DRUG$, an inhibitor of microsomal drug metabolism, increased @DRUG$s half-life and toxicity in a rat model.
3603	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ steady-state Cmax, A.C. and Cmin were increased 21%, decreased 19%, and decreased 48%, respectively, by concomitant @DRUG$.
3604	DDI-advise	Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of @DRUG$ 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution, the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants (alcohol, @DRUG$, opiates, sedatives, anesthetics) should be considered.
3605	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ has been reported to produce clinically significant fluctuations in steady-state serum concentrations of various @DRUG$.
3606	DDI-mechanism	In vitro studies have shown @DRUG$ can displace coumarin anticoagulants, such as @DRUG$, from their protein-binding sites.
3607	DDI-advise	In patients receiving concurrent therapy with clonidine, if therapy is to be discontinued, it is suggested that @DRUG$ be discontinued for several days before the withdrawal of @DRUG$.
3608	DDI-mechanism	The AUC of @DRUG$ was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days.
3609	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain @DRUG$, etc.).
3610	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, @DRUG$, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3611	DDI-mechanism	Allopurinol: The AUC of didanosine was increased about 4-fold when @DRUG$ at 300 mg/day was coadministered with a single 200-mg dose of @DRUG$ to two patients with renal impairment (CLcr=15 and 18 mL/min).
3612	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), @DRUG$ (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3613	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, @DRUG$, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3614	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, @DRUG$, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3615	DDI-mechanism	This report describes two cases in which @DRUG$ clearance accelerated markedly with concomitant @DRUG$ administration.
3616	DDI-mechanism	Carbamazepine: Elevated @DRUG$ levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
3617	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, nicotine, and rifampin may decrease @DRUG$ plasma levels, resulting in a decrease in effectiveness of a previously effective Clozapine dose.
3618	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, @DRUG$, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3619	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other @DRUG$, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3620	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic @DRUG$ abuse, reserpine
3621	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or @DRUG$ (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
3622	DDI-mechanism	Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of @DRUG$ when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing @DRUG$.
3623	DDI-advise	Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully, and the dose of warfarin sodium or other coumarin-like drugs should be adjusted accordingly, in patients taking both drugs.
3624	DDI-advise	Although no interaction between MAO inhibitors and @DRUG$ has been observed, it is not recommended for use with @DRUG$.
3625	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain @DRUG$ (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3626	DDI-advise	Theophylline serum levels should be monitored and appropriate dose adjustments considered for patients given both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3627	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with other @DRUG$.
3628	DDI-mechanism	There is a single case report, which suggests that @DRUG$ may interfere with @DRUG$ absorption.

3630	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Co-administration of 200 mg twice-daily @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in an approximate 80% increase in plasma levels of aliskiren.
3631	DDI-advise	On administration of oral @DRUG$, the need for @DRUG$ therapy should be reviewed and the dose reduced by approximately 50% or discontinued.
3632	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including @DRUG$, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3633	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant use of other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as @DRUG$ and erythromycin with transdermal @DRUG$ may also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause serious respiratory depression.
3634	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), @DRUG$ (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3635	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ 40 mg BID for 7 days produced significant decreases in @DRUG$ serum clearance (25%) and renal clearance (30%) with a 34% higher serum exposure compared to lithium alone.
3636	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), @DRUG$, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.

3639	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: @DRUG$, chronic alcohol abuse, reserpine
3640	DDI-advise	Based on these data, @DRUG$ should not be used in patients on @DRUG$ therapy.

3642	DDI-mechanism	"Antacids and kaolin: @DRUG$ and kaolin can reduce absorption of @DRUG$;"
3643	DDI-mechanism	Drugs such as @DRUG$ and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$ and thus decrease their clearance.
3644	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3645	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of @DRUG$ toxicity.
3646	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: @DRUG$ causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of @DRUG$  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3647	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ can interact with @DRUG$, increasing the metabolism of chlorpromazine.
3648	DDI-advise	Avoid the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and tramadol (@DRUG$).
3649	DDI-advise	Therefore, patients without a functioning @DRUG$ gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if @DRUG$ or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.
3650	DDI-mechanism	Blood levels of hydrodolasetron increased 24% when @DRUG$ was coadministered with @DRUG$ (nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days, and decreased 28% with coadministration of rifampin (potent inducer of cytochrome P-450) for 7 days.

3652	DDI-mechanism	Effects of Other Antiepileptic Drugs on Felbatol  Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol  (felbamate) at steady state and, therefore, the addition of @DRUG$ causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of @DRUG$  as compared to the same dose of Felbatol  given as monotherapy.
3653	DDI-advise	Other 5-HT1B/1D Agonists Concomitant use of other @DRUG$ within 24 hours of treatment with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3654	DDI-mechanism	This study demonstrates that concurrent administration of @DRUG$ permits at least a twofold increase in dose and total exposure to @DRUG$.
3655	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.
3656	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: As with other b-lactam antibiotics, @DRUG$ inhibits the renal excretion of @DRUG$, resulting in an approximate doubling in A.C. a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination half-life.
3657	DDI-advise	If the @DRUG$ dose is adjusted upward, the dose will need to be reduced upon discontinuation of @DRUG$ or other inducers.
3658	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), @DRUG$ (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3659	DDI-mechanism	Substances that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (eg, ketoconazole and @DRUG$) decrease gefitinib metabolism and increase @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3660	DDI-mechanism	Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, @DRUG$, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of @DRUG$ and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.
3661	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was coadministered with phenytoin, @DRUG$, or H2antagonists, reduced plasma concentrations of itraconazole were reported.
3662	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3663	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), @DRUG$, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3664	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3665	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3666	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may decrease the amount of digoxin (@DRUG$, Lanoxicaps) that gets absorbed into your body.
3667	DDI-advise	Digitalis: @DRUG$ dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with @DRUG$, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias.
3668	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ reduce the renal clearance of @DRUG$ and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
3669	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$ because of the potential for serious and/or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.
3670	DDI-mechanism	However, patients on @DRUG$ may show elevations of digoxin concentrations after initiation of therapy with @DRUG$, which may be clinically significant in patients prone to digoxin toxicity.
3671	DDI-advise	The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when coadministering these agents with @DRUG$.
3672	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, @DRUG$ (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3673	DDI-advise	Since @DRUG$ are potentiated by the @DRUG$, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions.
3674	DDI-mechanism	Increases in plasma levels of @DRUG$, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when @DRUG$ was added to the drug regimen.
3675	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as @DRUG$ and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
3676	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of @DRUG$, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3677	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with caution in patients who are receiving a @DRUG$ orally because of the potential for additive effects on systemic beta-blockade.
3678	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with @DRUG$, morphine, succinylcholine or warfarin.
3679	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or @DRUG$.
3680	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and methaqualone interact pharmacologically with orally administered @DRUG$, but the effect is not clinically significant.
3681	DDI-advise	Caution is advised when @DRUG$ is coadministered with other medications that can prolong the QT interval (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics or thioridazine) or lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as @DRUG$ or amphotericin B).
3682	DDI-advise	When @DRUG$ is co-administered with inducers of drug clearance, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$, use of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered
3683	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has a complex effect on oral @DRUG$ pharmacokinetics.
3684	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3685	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and @DRUG$.
3686	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, @DRUG$, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
3687	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3688	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other @DRUG$) and tetracycline may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3689	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concurrent administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in 50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations.
3690	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, @DRUG$, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3691	DDI-mechanism	Antidepressants: In vitro data indicate that @DRUG$ inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$, which can result in an increase in plasma cisapride levels and prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.
3692	DDI-advise	Magnesium: Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, @DRUG$) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with @DRUG$ by patients on chronic renal dialysis.
3693	DDI-mechanism	This observed increase in the bioavailability of fexofenadine may be due to transport-related effects, such as p-glycoprotein. in vivo animal studies also suggest that in addition to enhancing absorption, @DRUG$ decreases @DRUG$ gastrointestinal secretion, while erythromycin may also decrease biliary excretion.
3694	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of @DRUG$, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3695	DDI-mechanism	The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between @DRUG$ or its breakdown products and @DRUG$ in the gastrointestinal tract.
3696	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, @DRUG$), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3697	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ caused a statistically significant increase in plasma exposures of @DRUG$ and S-warfarin (12% and 15%, respectively), and in the pharmacodynamic effects (prothrombin time, measured as INR) of warfarin.
3698	DDI-mechanism	Theophylline: As with some other @DRUG$, concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin with @DRUG$ may lead to elevated serum concentrations of theophylline and prolongation of its elimination half-life.
3699	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3700	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
3701	DDI-mechanism	Based on total @DRUG$ concentrations, @DRUG$ increased the AUC by 25% and reduced the plasma and renal clearances by 20% and 35%, respectively.
3702	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ and cyclosporine, @DRUG$ or digoxin has led to increased plasma concentrations of the latter three drugs.
3703	DDI-mechanism	"Potential for reduction in @DRUG$ and/or @DRUG$ plasma levels;"
3704	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital: The coadministration of @DRUG$ or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of vitamin D, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of @DRUG$/ergocalcitriol by accelerating metabolism.
3705	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., @DRUG$, cerivastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin).
3706	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3707	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving @DRUG$, cautious titration is advised.
3708	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and @DRUG$), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3709	DDI-mechanism	The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: @DRUG$ tablets inhibit the metabolism of @DRUG$, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite.
3710	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
3711	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, @DRUG$, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3712	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin and produces an increase in the level of @DRUG$ in serum.
3713	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of @DRUG$ increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.
3714	DDI-advise	We report the case of an adolescent with altered consciousness caused by carbamazepine overdose with a positive tricyclic antidepressant level to alert clinicians to the cross-reactivity of @DRUG$ with a toxicology screen for @DRUG$.
3715	DDI-mechanism	In a study involving healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values.
3716	DDI-mechanism	Atorvastatin: @DRUG$ increases the AUC for norethindrone and @DRUG$.
3717	DDI-advise	Drugs that may alter imatinib plasma concentrations Drugs that may increase imatinib plasma concentrations: Caution is recommended when administering @DRUG$ with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, @DRUG$).
3718	DDI-advise	The consumption of @DRUG$ during treatment with @DRUG$ should be minimized or avoided (also see  a href= bupropz_od.htm#CI CONTRAINDICATIONS)
3719	DDI-mechanism	In a single-dose crossover study examining lansoprazole 30 mg and omeprazole 20 mg each administered alone and concomitantly with sucralfate 1 gram, absorption of the @DRUG$ was delayed and their bioavailability was reduced by 17% and 16%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3720	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of midazolam and @DRUG$ also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3721	DDI-mechanism	Lithium: @DRUG$ have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal @DRUG$ clearance.
3722	DDI-mechanism	Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral @DRUG$ potently inhibits the metabolism of @DRUG$ resulting in an eight-fold increase in the mean AUC of cisapride.
3723	DDI-advise	The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotensin can be minimized by either discontinuing the @DRUG$ or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with @DRUG$.
3724	DDI-advise	Because the potential interaction of @DRUG$ with oral @DRUG$ has not been fully characterized, a reliable method of barrier contraception should be used in addition to oral contraceptives.
3725	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as @DRUG$ and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
3726	DDI-mechanism	Cholestyramine and Charcoal Administration of cholestyramine or @DRUG$ in patients (n=13) and volunteers (n=96) resulted in a rapid and significant decrease in plasma M1 (the active metabolite of @DRUG$) concentration .
3727	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, @DRUG$, lovastatin, simvastatin).
3728	DDI-mechanism	Urinary alkalinizing agents (@DRUG$, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the @DRUG$ molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion.
3729	DDI-mechanism	Plasma levels of @DRUG$ may become subtherapeutic during @DRUG$ therapy.
3730	DDI-advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when @DRUG$ is coadministered with @DRUG$.
3731	DDI-mechanism	In healthy subjects receiving @DRUG$ (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma @DRUG$ levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.
3732	DDI-mechanism	Specific Effects of Felbatol  on Other Antiepileptic Drugs Phenytoin: @DRUG$  causes an increase in steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3733	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (@DRUG$, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3734	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, @DRUG$, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
3735	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, @DRUG$, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3736	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or @DRUG$, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3737	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, @DRUG$, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

3739	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or @DRUG$, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3740	DDI-int	@DRUG$ did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug, and the mechanism under lying the interference with @DRUG$s hypotensive effect is unknown.
3741	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as @DRUG$ (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3742	DDI-advise	Patients with major psychotic disorders, treated with @DRUG$, should be treated with @DRUG$ only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
3743	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, @DRUG$ supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3744	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are administered concomitantly.
3745	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with other @DRUG$.
3746	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ therapy is required, @DRUG$ concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.
3747	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, @DRUG$, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3748	DDI-mechanism	Saquinavir: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with @DRUG$ resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
3749	DDI-mechanism	Benzodiazepines: Combination @DRUG$ may decrease the clearance of some @DRUG$ (alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam) and increase the clearance of others (lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
3750	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given @DRUG$.
3751	DDI-mechanism	The elimination half life of @DRUG$ and triazolam also increased (1.5-2.5 fold) during coadministration with @DRUG$.
3752	DDI-mechanism	(1968, 1970), the higher serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and cephaloridine reached after administration of @DRUG$ are due not only to slower renal elimination but also to an altered distribution in the body.
3753	DDI-advise	Caution is advised in patients receiving concomitant high-dose @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, as anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy and coma have been rarely reported due to a possible drug interaction.
3754	DDI-advise	Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs.
3755	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to increase the @DRUG$ requirements in human subjects ingesting these agents simultaneously.
3756	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3757	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
3758	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin: In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin increased approximately 40% with coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4.
3759	DDI-mechanism	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been associated with a decrease in the excretion of oxypurines (hypoxanthine and xanthine) and an increase in urinary uric acid excretion compared with that observed with allopurinol alone.
3760	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (@DRUG$, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.

3762	DDI-mechanism	Absorption of @DRUG$ is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or @DRUG$, and iron-containing preparations.
3763	DDI-mechanism	Use in Conjunction with Other Antiepileptic Drugs: The addition of @DRUG$  to @DRUG$ (AEDs) affects the steady-state plasma concentrations of AEDs.
3764	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., @DRUG$, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous pentamidine, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3765	DDI-mechanism	There have been greater than 2-fold increases in previously stable plasma levels of other @DRUG$, including nortriptyline, when @DRUG$ has been administered in combination with these agents.
3766	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3767	DDI-mechanism	Elevated cyclosporine serum levels have been reported with the concomitant use of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$.
3768	DDI-mechanism	Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of @DRUG$ on the availability of @DRUG$ and digitoxin.
3769	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) blood levels may be increased and prolonged by concurrent administration of @DRUG$.
3770	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$  Tablets with @DRUG$ or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs.
3771	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
3772	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or @DRUG$ (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3773	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3774	DDI-int	@DRUG$ can interact with alcohol or other CNS depressants (may potentiate the CNS depressant effects of either these medications or antihistamines), @DRUG$ or other medications with anticholinergic activity (anticholinergic effects may be potentiated when these medications are used concurrently with antihistamines), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (concurrent use with antihistamines may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects of antihistamines).
3775	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3776	DDI-mechanism	Increasing the @DRUG$ dose to 1800 mg/day in six of these subjects increased the steady-state @DRUG$ Cmin to 25 7 micrograms/mL.
3777	DDI-mechanism	CONCLUSIONS: @DRUG$ inhibit the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, @DRUG$).
3778	DDI-advise	If additional @DRUG$ are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the pharmacologically predictable sympathetic effects of @DRUG$ may be potentiated.
3779	DDI-mechanism	In two clinical studies, @DRUG$ (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses) increased the AUC of @DRUG$ by approximately 35%.
3780	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
3781	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, @DRUG$, and increased toxicity.
3782	DDI-mechanism	"Separating the doses of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ minimizes this decrease in bioavailability;"
3783	DDI-mechanism	The @DRUG$ steady-state Cmin decreased 31% to 5 1 micrograms/mL when @DRUG$ (3000 mg/day, divided into three doses) was coadministered.
3784	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3785	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3786	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of @DRUG$.
3787	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as tetracycline penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and @DRUG$ preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
3788	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ excretion and the lithium may be decreased.
3789	DDI-mechanism	Even so @DRUG$ plasma concentrations in the presence of high doses of @DRUG$ were almost 5-fold lower than those seen in CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers suggesting that dose adjustment is not necessary.
3790	DDI-mechanism	Thus @DRUG$ appeared to alter the renal excretion of both @DRUG$ and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
3791	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of caffeine may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and ketoconazole) and higher @DRUG$ doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and phenytoin).
3792	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administration to three cancer patients over a dose range of 0.025 mg to 2.2 mg led to a dose-dependent inhibition of @DRUG$ elimination.14 The effect of alternate-day administration of 0.25 mg of Betaseron on drug metabolism in MS patients is unknown.
3793	DDI-mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH (histamine H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine or @DRUG$) may reduce plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ and therefore potentially may reduce efficacy.
3794	DDI-advise	Nephrotoxic agents : Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and agents with nephrotoxic potential [e.g., intravenous aminoglycosides (e.g., tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin), amphotericin B, foscarnet, intravenous @DRUG$, vancomycin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents] is contraindicated.
3795	DDI-mechanism	Aspirin: Concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
3796	DDI-advise	Patients on @DRUG$ treatment should be closely monitored when @DRUG$ is introduced or withdrawn.
3797	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
3798	DDI-advise	Monitoring for amiodarone toxicity and serial measurement of @DRUG$ serum concentration during concomitant @DRUG$ therapy should be considered.
3799	DDI-mechanism	Digoxin: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels.
3800	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: @DRUG$, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3801	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, @DRUG$, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
3802	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ may reduce plasma levels of @DRUG$.
3803	DDI-advise	Drugs Which Require a Dose Reduction When Coadminstered With @DRUG$ @DRUG$: rifabutin
3804	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, @DRUG$, or tobramycin.
3805	DDI-mechanism	Erythromycin and clarithromycin (and possibly other macrolide antibiotics) and @DRUG$ may increase @DRUG$ absorption in patients who inactivate digoxin by bacterial metabolism in the lower intestine, so that digitalis intoxication may result.
3806	DDI-mechanism	If @DRUG$ or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with Norpace or @DRUG$, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur.
3807	DDI-advise	Although the clinical significance is not known, it is not recommended that @DRUG$ be taken concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3808	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, @DRUG$, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
3809	DDI-mechanism	"Protease inhibitors: Amprenavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, and ritonavir have been shown to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
3810	DDI-advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ Capsules are administered concomitantly with @DRUG$.
3811	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, @DRUG$, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
3812	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and @DRUG$ may increase plasma levels of @DRUG$, potentially resulting in adverse effects.
3813	DDI-mechanism	Coadministration of @DRUG$ significantly decreased @DRUG$ plasma concentrations.
3814	DDI-mechanism	plasma levels of several closely related @DRUG$ have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., @DRUG$, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well.
3815	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may also decrease the absorption of @DRUG$, which can lead to a deficiency.
3816	DDI-mechanism	We propose these pharmacokinetic changes to be the underlying mechanism for the reduction of oral @DRUG$ cytotoxicity by @DRUG$.
3817	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, @DRUG$, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
3818	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, @DRUG$, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
3819	DDI-mechanism	Phenytoin: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that @DRUG$ clearance is 60% greater in patients taking @DRUG$ with or without other enzyme- inducing AEDs.
3820	DDI-advise	Use lowest possible dose of @DRUG$ with careful monitoring, or consider HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, such as pravastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin in combination with @DRUG$.
3821	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: carbamazepine, chronic alcohol abuse, @DRUG$
3822	DDI-mechanism	Plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ are decreased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, @DRUG$, or aluminum.
3823	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3824	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide and @DRUG$ reduce the oral absorption of @DRUG$ by 75%.
3825	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ significantly decreased the AUC(ss) of @DRUG$ by 82%, but amprenavir had no effect on rifampin pharmacokinetics.
3826	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole: Coadministration of @DRUG$ (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of @DRUG$ increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.
3827	DDI-mechanism	Phenobarbital: It appears that @DRUG$ may reduce plasma @DRUG$ concentrations.
3828	DDI-advise	Although a causal mechanism and a cause-and-effect relationship have not been established, current evidence suggests that renal function should be monitored in patients on @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ even in the absence of renal failure, and dosage levels should be even more conservatively adjusted in those patients on such combined therapy if diminished renal function is detected..
3829	DDI-mechanism	In addition, results from regression analyses of patient pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of other inducers of drug clearance (efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or @DRUG$) with @DRUG$ may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin concentrations.
3830	DDI-mechanism	When @DRUG$ was administered concomitantly with @DRUG$ (CYP1A2, CYP3A), a minor increase (10%) in the clearance of theophylline was seen.
3831	DDI-mechanism	Concurrent use of @DRUG$ increases the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in a shortened elimination half-life of ZEBETA.
3832	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, @DRUG$, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
3833	DDI-mechanism	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, indinavir, @DRUG$, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib and should be avoided.
3834	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
3835	DDI-mechanism	Probenecid: @DRUG$ increases both free and bound @DRUG$ by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
3836	DDI-mechanism	Barbiturates, @DRUG$, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
3837	DDI-mechanism	Terfenadine, astemizole and @DRUG$ are all metabolized by the cytochrome P450IIIA4 isozyme, and it has been demonstrated that @DRUG$, a potent inhibitor of IIIA4, blocks the metabolism of these drugs, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug.
3838	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, @DRUG$ (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3839	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
3840	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
3841	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or @DRUG$, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic analgesics, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3842	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and quinidine.
3843	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
3844	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3845	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporin: After introduction of @DRUG$ (oral form), a sudden increase in serum @DRUG$ level has been reported.
3846	DDI-mechanism	Additional @DRUG$ significantly inhibited the absorption of cobalt in both dietary @DRUG$ treatments.
3847	DDI-advise	Considerable caution should be exercised if @DRUG$ is administered concurrently with Phenurone (@DRUG$) since paranoid symptoms have been reported during therapy with this combination.
3848	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3849	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, @DRUG$, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3850	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, @DRUG$, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, dantrolene, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
3851	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be administered with caution to patients who are taking other psychoactive drugs or CNS depressants, including alcohol, barbiturates and @DRUG$, or to those with a history of psychiatric disorder (including manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia).
3852	DDI-advise	Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, @DRUG$ should not be taken with @DRUG$-containing antacid preparations.
3853	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
3854	DDI-advise	Although it has not been established that there is an interaction between Clozapine and benzodiazepines or other psychotropics, caution is advised when @DRUG$ is initiated in patients taking a benzodiazepine or any other @DRUG$.
3855	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, @DRUG$, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3856	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with other @DRUG$ (such as isoproterenol) because of possible additive effects and increased toxicity.
3857	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, quinidine Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines @DRUG$, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
3858	DDI-advise	Therefore, it is recommended that @DRUG$ Tablets not be used in combination with MAOIs, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a @DRUG$.
3859	DDI-advise	@DRUG$, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or sucralfate should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
3860	DDI-advise	Blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored when @DRUG$ and oral @DRUG$ are coadministered.
3861	DDI-advise	Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of the @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.
3862	DDI-int	Interaction of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ in vitro.
3863	DDI-int	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
3864	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, @DRUG$, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
3865	DDI-advise	therefore, @DRUG$ or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
3866	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, @DRUG$, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
3867	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (@DRUG$, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3868	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as @DRUG$ (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3869	DDI-advise	When concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose.
3870	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., @DRUG$, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3871	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
3872	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), @DRUG$ (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
3873	DDI-advise	Therefore concomitant administration of @DRUG$ tablets with @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
3874	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly.
3875	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), @DRUG$ (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3876	DDI-advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
3877	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin and @DRUG$) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3878	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), @DRUG$, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3879	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (@DRUG$), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
3880	DDI-advise	However, when any additional drug, including @DRUG$, is added to the treatment of patients on @DRUG$ therapy, the patients should be observed for alterations of the prothrombin time.
3881	DDI-advise	Alternatives to @DRUG$ should be considered during the course of PCP treatment with @DRUG$.
3882	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local @DRUG$ (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
3883	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, @DRUG$, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
3884	DDI-advise	Acellular, live and @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
3885	DDI-advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., @DRUG$, metformin and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase @DRUG$ levels.
3886	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, @DRUG$, NSAIDs like Aleve or Ibuprofen, and high blood pressure medications.
3887	DDI-advise	It is advisable to check coagulation time within the first few days after the start and discontinuation of @DRUG$ therapy, with an appropriate adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose, if necessary.
3888	DDI-advise	Therefore, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored in patients receiving @DRUG$ and @DRUG$-like drugs simultaneously.
3889	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., cimetidine and @DRUG$) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
3890	DDI-advise	Although the interaction between almotriptan and other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, ritonavir, and erythromycin) has not been studied, increased exposures to almotriptan may be expected when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with these medications.

4001	DDI-advise	Consequently, it is recommended that @DRUG$ not be used in combination with either @DRUG$, astemizole, or cisapride.
4002	DDI-advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all NSAIDs, including @DRUG$, and @DRUG$ requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.
4003	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
4004	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.
4005	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
4006	DDI-advise	Refer to the package insert for @DRUG$ preparations before use of such preparations with @DRUG$
4007	DDI-advise	5HT3 Antagonists: Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of @DRUG$ with drugs of the 5HT3 antagonist class (including, for example, ondansetron, @DRUG$, dolasetron, palonosetron, and alosetron) is contraindicated .

4029	DDI-advise	Dosage adjustment of @DRUG$ may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and @DRUG$.
4030	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of naproxen and aspirin is not recommended because @DRUG$ is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of @DRUG$, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and peak plasma levels.
4031	DDI-advise	Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, @DRUG$, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
4032	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and @DRUG$ [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as disopyramide, are used concurrently.
4033	DDI-advise	Because dexfenfluramine is a serotonin releaser and reuptake inhibitor, @DRUG$ should not be used concomitantly with a @DRUG$.
4034	DDI-advise	Aspirin: As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

4036	DDI-advise	Because a similar interaction is likely, @DRUG$ should also not be administered concurrently with @DRUG$.
4037	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B and intravenous @DRUG$ unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
4038	DDI-advise	Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken with other centrally acting drugs and @DRUG$.
4039	DDI-advise	These results would seem to dictate against the clinical use of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$, or during the period following ELSPAR therapy when plasma asparagine levels are below normal.
4040	DDI-advise	If concomitant treatment with @DRUG$ and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, @DRUG$) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised.
