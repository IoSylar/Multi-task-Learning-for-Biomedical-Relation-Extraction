110	DDI-mechanism	Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 47% decrease in ethinyl estradiol and an 18% decrease in norethindrone plasma concentrations.
111	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
112	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents.
113	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
114	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
115	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
116	DDI-mechanism	Ephedrine: @DRUG$ may enhance the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
117	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
118	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
119	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
120	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
121	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
122	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
123	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: @DRUG$, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide.
124	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or @DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
125	DDI-effect	There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of @DRUG$ that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
126	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
127	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
128	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
129	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
130	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
131	DDI-effect	Cytotoxic Agents: Enhanced bone marrow suppression by @DRUG$ and other cytotoxic agents has been reported among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia, in the presence of @DRUG$.
132	DDI-mechanism	- Drugs that may either increase or decrease plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: phenobarbital, vaiproic acid, and @DRUG$.
133	DDI-mechanism	Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and @DRUG$, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of @DRUG$.
134	DDI-effect	In some patients, the administration of @DRUG$ can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of @DRUG$.
135	DDI-int	@DRUG$ and atropine sulfate may interact with @DRUG$ In studies with male rats, diphenoxylate hydrochloride was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day.
136	DDI-effect	Haloperidol: @DRUG$ blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of @DRUG$.
137	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ demonstrates some limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 which may present a theoretical potential for interaction with other coadministered medicinal products sharing that clearance mechanism e.g. @DRUG$.
138	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another @DRUG$ such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol);"
139	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, pimozide, carbamazepine, fentanyl, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
140	DDI-mechanism	This antagonistic effect of @DRUG$ on @DRUG$ natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide.
141	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
142	DDI-effect	As with some other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the time of onset of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$ is lengthened and the duration of block is shortened in patients receiving phenytoin or @DRUG$.
143	DDI-advise	The physician should be cautious when administering @DRUG$ to patients taking @DRUG$.
144	DDI-mechanism	In vitro data suggest that @DRUG$, when compared to ketoconazole, has a less pronounced effect on the biotransformation system responsible for the metabolism of @DRUG$.
145	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as @DRUG$, amphotericin B and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
146	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, @DRUG$(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
147	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of @DRUG$ at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of @DRUG$ on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%).
148	DDI-advise	therefore, nitroglycerin or other @DRUG$ (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting @DRUG$.
149	DDI-mechanism	Levothyroxine Sodium Absorption: The following agents may bind and decrease absorption of @DRUG$ from the gastrointestinal tract: aluminum hydoxide, cholestyramine resin, colestipol hydrochloride, ferrous sulfate, @DRUG$, soybean flour (e.g., infant formula), sucralfate.
150	DDI-mechanism	Interactions with Other Antiretroviral Drugs: Significant decreases in the AUC of @DRUG$ (20%) and indinavir (84%) occurred following simultaneous administration of these agents with @DRUG$.
151	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with paroxetine, @DRUG$, and sertraline.
152	DDI-mechanism	therefore, it is theoretically possible that @DRUG$ may interfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability (e.g. ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, iron salts, @DRUG$).
153	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
154	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
155	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, @DRUG$, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
156	DDI-effect	In patients receiving nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (@DRUG$) (e.g., selegiline hydrochloride) in combination with @DRUG$ (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions.
157	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
158	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or @DRUG$;"
159	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, @DRUG$, succinylcholine or warfarin.
160	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .
161	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: @DRUG$ have been reported to competitively inhibit @DRUG$ accumulation in rabbit kidney slices.
162	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
163	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (@DRUG$ [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
164	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline and @DRUG$, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
165	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be avoided by patients with a history of serious reaction to any @DRUG$, including Solganal and Myochrysine.
166	DDI-mechanism	DISCUSSION: @DRUG$ is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the major enzyme responsible for @DRUG$ metabolism.
167	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors that have been found, or are expected, to increase plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: Acetazolamide, azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin(1), dalfopristin, danazol, delavirdine, diltiazem, erythromycin(1), @DRUG$, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, loratadine, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, protease inhibitors, propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, troleandomycin, valproate(1), verapamil, zileuton.
168	DDI-advise	Drug-Drug Interactions Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when @DRUG$ is taken in combination with other @DRUG$ and alcohol.
169	DDI-mechanism	However, in the second study, administration of 12 g @DRUG$ 1 hour before the evening meal and 0.3 mg @DRUG$ approximately 4 hours after the same evening meal resulted in a decrease in the cerivastatin AUC of less than 8%, and a decrease in Cmax of about 30% when compared to dosing cerivastatin sodium alone.
170	DDI-advise	If the two drugs are coadministered, the @DRUG$ should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of @DRUG$.
171	DDI-advise	If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of @DRUG$ should be delayed for several days after @DRUG$ administration has stopped.
172	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and @DRUG$, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.
173	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, @DRUG$) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
174	DDI-mechanism	When used in therapeutic doses, @DRUG$ had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, carbamazepine, cetirizine, didanosine, efavirenz, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazolam, @DRUG$/sulfamethoxazole or zidovudine.
175	DDI-effect	Dopamine Antagonists: Since apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (@DRUG$, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of @DRUG$.
176	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state serum concentrations of @DRUG$ are reported to fluctuate significantly when @DRUG$ is either added or deleted from the drug regimen.
177	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is also expected to reduce plasma concentrations of other @DRUG$ that have significant metabolism by CYP3A4, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin.
178	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, a trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine, prevents gastrointestinal effects of intravenous @DRUG$ without affecting analgesia.
179	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ administered 2 hours before @DRUG$ resulted in a slower absorption (mean C max decreased by 30% and mean T max increased by 1 hour) and a lesser extent of absorption (mean AUC decreased by approximately 25%).
180	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
181	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$ and magnesium hydroxide reduce the oral absorption of @DRUG$ by 75%.
182	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., @DRUG$ and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
183	DDI-effect	Methadone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ can decrease plasma levels of methadone.
184	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: phenothiazines, haloperidol, @DRUG$, pimozide.
185	DDI-advise	The daily dose of @DRUG$ should not exceed 7.5 mg when coadministered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, @DRUG$ and nefazadone) .
186	DDI-mechanism	Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as @DRUG$) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of @DRUG$.
187	DDI-effect	The extent to which @DRUG$-@DRUG$ interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.
188	DDI-mechanism	Administration of @DRUG$ has been reported to increase the plasma levels of @DRUG$, if given concomitantly.
189	DDI-mechanism	The administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with known microsomal enzyme inducer (@DRUG$ or phenytoin) to two patients with renal impairment reportedly resulted in significant reductions in elimination half-life and plasma concentration.
190	DDI-advise	The IV methylprednisolone dose should be reduced by approximately 25%, and the oral @DRUG$ dose should be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with @DRUG$ to achieve exposures of methylprednisolone similar to those obtained when it is given without Aprepitant.
191	DDI-mechanism	Rifampin: Coadministration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ resulted in an 82% decrease in nelfinavir plasma A.C.
192	DDI-mechanism	Amitriptyline: Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg @DRUG$ with 50 mg @DRUG$ increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline (active metabolite) exposure by approximately 20% in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
193	DDI-advise	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., @DRUG$), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.
194	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with alcohol, blood thinners, decongestant drugs (allergy, cold, and sinus medicines), diabetic drugs, lithium, norepinephrine, NSAIDs like Aleve or @DRUG$, and high blood pressure medications.
195	DDI-mechanism	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, @DRUG$, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of @DRUG$.
196	DDI-effect	Uricosuric Agents: @DRUG$ may decrease the effects of probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, and @DRUG$.
197	DDI-effect	Butalbital, acetaminophen and @DRUG$ may enhance the effects of: other @DRUG$s, alcohol, general anesthetics, tranquilizers such as chlordiazepoxide, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants, causing increased CNS depression.
198	DDI-mechanism	Quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone, indomethacin, @DRUG$, alprazolam, and spironolactone raise the serum @DRUG$ concentration due to a reduction in clearance and/or in volume of distribution of the drug, with the implication that digitalis intoxication may result.
199	DDI-effect	When taken orally , @DRUG$ like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of @DRUG$-like drugs.
200	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ and @DRUG$ may have additive hypotensite effects due to the inhibition of each other s metabolism.
201	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of @DRUG$.
202	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ modifies @DRUG$ metabolism with increased serum levels of phenytoin.
203	DDI-effect	Sildenafil citrate - Theoretically, @DRUG$ supplements taken concomitantly with @DRUG$, may potentiate the effects of the drug.
204	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, tubocurarine) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, @DRUG$ and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
205	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
206	DDI-mechanism	Triazolam: @DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.
207	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with @DRUG$.
208	DDI-effect	Pretreatment of rats with @DRUG$ (100 mg/kg, ip) or Vitamin E (100 mg/kg per day, ig, for 3 days and a dose of 40 mg/kg on the 4th day) provided significant protection against the elevation of TBARS levels in cerebral and hepatic tissues, induced by single high dose of oral @DRUG$ administration within 4 h.
209	DDI-mechanism	Steady-state @DRUG$ plasma concentrations were 3- to 4-fold higher than in the absence of @DRUG$.
210	DDI-mechanism	"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): @DRUG$ may decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$;"
211	DDI-effect	Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: @DRUG$, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of @DRUG$.
212	DDI-mechanism	"Although specific studies have not been performed, coadministration with drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, and triazolam) may have elevated plasma concentrations when coadministered with @DRUG$;"
213	DDI-mechanism	Methotrexate: Ibuprofen, as well as other @DRUG$, probably reduces the tubular secretion of @DRUG$ based on in vitro studies in rabbit kidney slices.
214	DDI-effect	Thus, the results suggest that @DRUG$ exposure of rats results in free radical-mediated tissue damage, as indicated by elevated cerebral and hepatic lipid peroxidation, which was prevented by @DRUG$ and Vitamin E.
215	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and @DRUG$), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
216	DDI-effect	Pyrantel (e.g., Antiminth) - Taking @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ together may decrease the effects of piperazine.
217	DDI-mechanism	Acidifying agents: @DRUG$ (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of @DRUG$.
218	DDI-effect	Iodine or iodine excess may decrease the effect of Carbimazole, and an @DRUG$ deficiency can increase the effect of @DRUG$.
219	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by @DRUG$, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
220	DDI-effect	When @DRUG$ is taken concurrently with oral @DRUG$, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded.
221	DDI-mechanism	Co-medications that induce CYP 3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, @DRUG$, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John s wort) may significantly decrease exposure to @DRUG$.
222	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ resin may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, thiazide diuretics (acidic) or propranolol (basic), as well as @DRUG$ penicillin G, phenobarbital, thyroid and thyroxine preparations, estrogens and progestins, and digitalis.
223	DDI-effect	Concurrent administration of drugs possessing nephrotoxic (e.g., aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin) or hepatotoxic (e.g., @DRUG$, asparaginase) effects with @DRUG$ may increase toxicity in these organ systems.
224	DDI-effect	Concomitant use of @DRUG$ usually depresses @DRUG$ activity and may necessitate raising the dosage.
225	DDI-effect	The action of the @DRUG$ may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, @DRUG$, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression.
226	DDI-mechanism	The half-life of @DRUG$ in plasma and brain was longer in the presence of @DRUG$ than when ketamine was given alone.
227	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, @DRUG$, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
228	DDI-mechanism	The most commonly occurring drug interactions are listed below: - Drugs that may increase plasma @DRUG$ concentrations include: acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chboramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, cimetidine, diazepam, dicumarol, disulfiram, @DRUG$, ethosuximide, fluoxetine, H2-antagonists, halothane, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, phenylbutazone, salicylates, succinimides, sulfonamides, tolbutamide, trazodone
229	DDI-effect	In post-marketing experience, bleeding events have been reported, predominantly in the elderly, in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving @DRUG$ concurrently with @DRUG$.
230	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to increase the bioavailability of @DRUG$.
231	DDI-effect	Injection: Lorazepam injection, like other injectable @DRUG$, produces depression of the central nervous system when administered with ethyl alcohol, @DRUG$, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants.When scopolamine is used concomitantly with injectable lorazepam, an increased incidence of sedation, hallucinations, and irrational behavior has been observed.
232	DDI-mechanism	While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, @DRUG$).
233	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, @DRUG$, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).
234	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ and SUBOXONE should be prescribed with caution to patients on @DRUG$ or other drugs that act on the central nervous system, regardless of whether these drugs are taken on the advice of a physician or are taken as drugs of abuse.
235	DDI-advise	Concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ capsules is not recommended.
236	DDI-mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with products containing iron, multivitamins containing zinc, or Videx (@DRUG$) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution may result in low urine levels.
237	DDI-advise	Administration of @DRUG$ Tablets to patients receiving either levodopa or @DRUG$ concurrently should be undertaken with caution, using small initial doses and small gradual dose increases.
238	DDI-mechanism	Antacids containing @DRUG$, when administered concomitantly with @DRUG$, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption.
239	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to change the bioavailabillty @DRUG$ when they are co-administered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
240	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, @DRUG$, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
241	DDI-effect	Curariform muscle relaxants (eg, @DRUG$) and other drugs, including ether, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium and sodium citrate, potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effect and should be used with extreme caution in patients being treated with @DRUG$ Parenteral.
242	DDI-advise	Monitoring of liver enzymes is recommended when @DRUG$ is used in combination with @DRUG$.

248	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, or @DRUG$.
249	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ is a potential inhibitor of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme in vivo as indicated by its ability to inhibit the in vitro metabolism of @DRUG$.
250	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and @DRUG$), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
251	DDI-mechanism	Ketoconazole - Combined administration of racemic @DRUG$ (40 mg) and @DRUG$ (200 mg) decreased the Cmax and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.

253	DDI-effect	International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations and/or bleeding events have been reported in some patients taking @DRUG$ while on @DRUG$ therapy.
254	DDI-mechanism	While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between @DRUG$ and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, @DRUG$, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.
255	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be administered concurrently with D2-antagonists, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthines, or @DRUG$.
256	DDI-effect	Other depressasnts such as alcohol, @DRUG$, and MAOIs may enhance CNS depression when administered with @DRUG$.
257	DDI-effect	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or @DRUG$ are used concurrently with @DRUG$.
258	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), @DRUG$ such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
259	DDI-mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Benzodiazepines: @DRUG$ metabolized by hepatic oxidation (e.g., alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam elc.) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by @DRUG$.
260	DDI-advise	For this reason, the dose of the @DRUG$ should be reduced by 30 - 50% at the start of treatment with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard and then titrated according to the blood clotting parameters
261	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should be used with care when myocardial depressants or inhibitors of AV conduction, such as certain calcium antagonists (particularly of the phenylalkylamine [verapamil] and benzothiazepine [diltiazem] classes), or antiarrhythmic agents, such as @DRUG$, are used concurrently.
262	DDI-effect	Cyclosporine: Because @DRUG$ can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of @DRUG$ including TRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration.
263	DDI-mechanism	Agents that are CYP inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of @DRUG$ are the following: @DRUG$, doxorubicin HCL, felbamate, rifampin, phenobarbital, Phenytoin(2), primidone, methsuximide, and theophylline Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on EQUETROTM, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for EQUETROTM may be necessary.
264	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local @DRUG$, procainamide, and quinidine.
265	DDI-effect	Cyclopropane or @DRUG$ increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered @DRUG$, such as dopamine.
266	DDI-effect	Although neither @DRUG$ nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of @DRUG$ and insulin.
267	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, @DRUG$, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.

273	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: Combination @DRUG$ may increase the clearance of @DRUG$.
274	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, phenytoin, or rifampin increased metabolic clearance of @DRUG$ because of the induction of hepatic enzymes.
275	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ may displace acidic drugs such as phenytoin or @DRUG$ from their binding sites.
276	DDI-mechanism	Antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, @DRUG$, cholestyramine, certain anticancer drugs, and metoclopramide may interfere with intestinal @DRUG$ absorption, resulting in unexpectedly low serum concentrations.

286	DDI-effect	The prior administration of @DRUG$ does not enhance the duration, but quickens the onset and may increase the depth, of neuromuscular block induced by @DRUG$.
287	DDI-advise	In patients receiving mercaptopurine (Purinethol) or azathioprine (Imuran), the concomitant administration of 300-600 mg of @DRUG$ per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one-third to one-fourth of the usual dose of @DRUG$ or azathioprine.
288	DDI-effect	The hypoglycemic action of @DRUG$ may be potentiated by certain drugs including @DRUG$ and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
289	DDI-mechanism	- Cholestyramine and colestipol resins: Cholestytamine and @DRUG$ resins have the potential of binding @DRUG$ and reducing diuretic absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
290	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of @DRUG$.

302	DDI-advise	A dose increase of @DRUG$/ritonavir to 533/133 mg (4 capsules or 6.5 mL) twice daily taken with food is recommended when used in combination with @DRUG$.
303	DDI-effect	Patients receiving other narcotic analgesics, general @DRUG$, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with @DRUG$ may exhibit an additive CNS depression.
304	DDI-advise	Magnesium- and/or aluminum-containing antacids, products containing ferrous sulfate (@DRUG$), multivitamin preparations containing zinc or other metal cations, or Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution should not be taken within 3 hours before or 2 hours after @DRUG$.
305	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ diminished the binding of @DRUG$ to human serum by a net change of 5.7% (percentage increase in free drug fraction [FDF], 11.0%) at 662 micromol/L and by a net change of 7.1% (percentage increase in FDF, 13.7%) at 1324 micromol/L.
306	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ or other CNS depressants, causing increased sedative effects.
307	DDI-effect	Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or @DRUG$.

313	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been reported to decrease the clearance of @DRUG$ and midazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.
314	DDI-effect	For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with @DRUG$ and a @DRUG$ do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.
315	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate @DRUG$, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of @DRUG$, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity.
316	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ increases the clearance of @DRUG$ by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase.
317	DDI-effect	@DRUG$, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs may increase anticholinergic effect of @DRUG$.
318	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased @DRUG$ plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
319	DDI-mechanism	"The absorption of tetracycline, @DRUG$, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with @DRUG$;"

321	DDI-mechanism	however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of @DRUG$ decreased @DRUG$ protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
322	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be used with @DRUG$.
323	DDI-advise	The concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ is contraindicated.
324	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., @DRUG$, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
325	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of benzodiazepines other than @DRUG$ suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: ergotamine, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
326	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), @DRUG$ (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
327	DDI-advise	Therefore, @DRUG$ should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to @DRUG$.
328	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, @DRUG$, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.

337	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
338	DDI-mechanism	However, other published reports describe modest elevations (less than two-fold) of clozapine and metabolite concentrations when @DRUG$ was taken with @DRUG$, fluoxetine, and sertraline.
339	DDI-effect	ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (Hypertension)- In clinical studies of patients with hypertension, the addition of @DRUG$ 50 to 100 mg to @DRUG$ and angiotensin II receptor antagonists increased mean serum potassium slightly (about 0.09-0.13 mEq/L).

348	DDI-advise	Avoid the use of preparations such as decongestants and local anesthetics which contain any @DRUG$ (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that @DRUG$ can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
349	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and @DRUG$ (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
350	DDI-effect	Intrathecal injection of @DRUG$ at doses of 0.4 to 40 micrograms caused a dose-related blockade of the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by intraventricular injection of @DRUG$, and a high dose of naloxone (40 micrograms) completely blocked the tail-flick inhibition induced by intraventricular beta-endorphin (16 micrograms).

355	DDI-effect	Exposure of the muscle to @DRUG$ (10(-5) M) markedly increased the @DRUG$-induced release.
356	DDI-advise	If any signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents (@DRUG$ or concomitant @DRUG$).
357	DDI-advise	If intravenous @DRUG$ is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with @DRUG$ should be interrupted.
358	DDI-mechanism	Ingestion of @DRUG$ may increase serum concentrations of @DRUG$ and methotrexate and increase cyclosporine s nephrotoxicity.
359	DDI-mechanism	Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that @DRUG$ may impair absorption of @DRUG$.

365	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, @DRUG$ and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
366	DDI-effect	"Antidepressants, tricyclic: @DRUG$ may enhance the activity of tricyclic or @DRUG$;"
367	DDI-int	Clinical studies with @DRUG$ have identified potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and @DRUG$.
368	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be combined with other @DRUG$.
369	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, @DRUG$, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
370	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during enflurane or @DRUG$ anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
371	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with antidepressants, aspirin, barbiturates, bromocriptine, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, @DRUG$, nicotine, somatropin, tamoxifen, and warfarin.
372	DDI-effect	Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving @DRUG$, and it is possible that the administration of @DRUG$ as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of this effect.
373	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, @DRUG$ and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
374	DDI-effect	Drugs Decreasing Heparin Effect: Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, or @DRUG$ may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of @DRUG$.
375	DDI-effect	Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if @DRUG$ is given with @DRUG$ or barbituates.
376	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, @DRUG$, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
377	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including @DRUG$, phenothiazines, carbamazepine, and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution.
378	DDI-effect	Methotrexate - There is one report that @DRUG$ may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental @DRUG$ for chemotherapy-induced mucositis.
379	DDI-effect	Antacids: Concomitant administration of antacids containing magnesium or @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ Chewable/Dispersible Buffered Tablets or Pediatric Powder for Oral Solution may potentiate adverse events associated with the antacid components.
380	DDI-effect	There is one report suggesting that the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride (@DRUG$) and @DRUG$ may have caused 3- to 6-fold elevations on SGPT (ALT) in a few patients.
381	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as @DRUG$ include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), @DRUG$ salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine.
382	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), @DRUG$ (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.

387	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, @DRUG$), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
388	DDI-advise	Consequently, concomitant administration of @DRUG$ with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., @DRUG$, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) should be approached with caution.
389	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, @DRUG$, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
390	DDI-advise	Based on adult data, lower doses of @DRUG$ may be needed following coadministration of drugs which are reported to decrease caffeine elimination (e.g., @DRUG$ and ketoconazole) and higher caffeine doses may be needed following coadministration of drugs that increase caffeine elimination (e.g., phenobarbital and phenytoin).
391	DDI-advise	Caution should be exercised during the administration of @DRUG$ to patients anaesthetised with @DRUG$ as arrhythmias may be precipitated.
392	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), @DRUG$ (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
393	DDI-int	Data from in vitro studies of @DRUG$ other than alprazolam suggest a possible drug interaction for the following: @DRUG$, cyclosporine, amiodarone, nicardipine, and nifedipine.
394	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ also should be used cautiously with other drugs (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$) that sensitize the myocardium to the actions of sympathomimetic drugs.
395	DDI-advise	Additionally, @DRUG$ should not be used to control supraventricular tachycardia in the presence of agents which are vasoconstrictive and inotropic such as dopamine, epinephrine, and @DRUG$ because of the danger of blocking cardiac contractility when systemic vascular resistance is high.
396	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, @DRUG$, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
397	DDI-advise	Acellular, @DRUG$ should not be administered during @DRUG$ treatment.
398	DDI-advise	Close observation of the patient is recommended when a @DRUG$ is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as @DRUG$, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope or postural hypotension.
399	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), @DRUG$ (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
400	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: @DRUG$ (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
401	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with @DRUG$ (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), procainamide (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).
402	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ injection and @DRUG$ should not be administered simultaneously because both drugs are direct cardiac stimulants and their combined effects may induce serious arrhythmias.
403	DDI-advise	Exert particular caution in combining @DRUG$ with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and @DRUG$): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma.
404	DDI-advise	In the case that you are taking @DRUG$ while taking @DRUG$, higher doses of digoxin may be needed.
405	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), chloramphenicol (e.g., Chloromycetin), local anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine and lidocaine), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)-containing preparations (e.g., sunscreens and some multivitamins), @DRUG$ (e.g., Pronestyl), sulfonamides (sulfa medicines), thiazide diuretics (use of these medicines during the test period will affect the test results), and pancreatic supplements (use of pancreatic supplements may give false test results).

409	DDI-int	@DRUG$ may interact with the following medications: acetaminophen (Tylenol), antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracycline, anticonvulsants (Dilantin, @DRUG$, Tegretol, Trileptal, Topamax, Felbatol), antifungals (Gris-PEG, Nizoral, Sporanox), atorvastatin (Lipitor), clofibrate (Atromid-S), cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), HIV drugs classified as protease inhibitors (Agenerase, Crixivan, Fortovase, Invirase, Kaletra, Norvir, Viracept), morphine (Astramorph, Kadian, MS Contin), phenylbutazone, prednisolone (Prelone), rifadin (rifampin), St. Johns wort, temazepam, theophylline (Theo-Dur), and vitamin C.
410	DDI-advise	Also, due to the potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block, caution is warranted in patients receiving @DRUG$ with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction (e.g., digitalis, @DRUG$, and beta-blockers.)
411	DDI-advise	"Dose adjustment of @DRUG$ may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., @DRUG$, erythromycin, itraconazole;"
412	DDI-advise	- Lithium: @DRUG$ should generally not be given with diuretics (such as @DRUG$) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
413	DDI-advise	However, because some quinolones have been reported to enhance the effects of warfarin or its derivatives, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored closely if a @DRUG$ is administered with @DRUG$ or its derivatives.
414	DDI-advise	Caution should be taken when @DRUG$ is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window, such as flecainide, @DRUG$ and tricyclic antidepressants (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).
415	DDI-advise	Although the interactions observed in these studies do not appear to be of major clinical importance, @DRUG$ should be titrated with caution in patients being treated concurrently with digoxin, morphine, succinylcholine or @DRUG$.
416	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, @DRUG$), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.

418	DDI-advise	Therefore, when @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are used concomitantly, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored.
419	DDI-advise	Because of foscarnets tendency to cause renal impairment, the use of @DRUG$ should be avoided in combination with potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, @DRUG$ and intravenous pentamidine unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the patient.
420	DDI-advise	Caution should be used when administering or taking @DRUG$ with ketoconazole and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and @DRUG$ .

422	DDI-int	Clinical implications of @DRUG$ interactions with five @DRUG$.
423	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with other drugs that are extensively metabolized by this isozyme and which have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as @DRUG$, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution.
424	DDI-advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With @DRUG$ Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, @DRUG$ Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine Antimigraine: ergot derivatives Antimycobacterial agents: rifampin Benzodiazepines midazolam, triazolam GI motility agents: cisapride
425	DDI-advise	- When @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard is used concurrently with @DRUG$ (e.g. cholestryramine), an interval of at least 2 hours should be maintained between the two medicines, since the absorption of Bezalip or Bezalip retard is impaired
426	DDI-advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral @DRUG$ upon beginning or stopping @DRUG$. since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
427	DDI-advise	@DRUG$   should be used with caution in patients receiving other local @DRUG$ or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics since the toxic effects of these drugs could be additive.
428	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., @DRUG$), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
429	DDI-advise	Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics: Agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, @DRUG$, dezocine and buprenorphine) should NOT be administered to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure agonist opioid analgesic such as @DRUG$.
