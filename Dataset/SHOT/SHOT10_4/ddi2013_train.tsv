0	DDI-false	Since amiodarone is a substrate for @DRUG$, there is the potential that the use of St. John s Wort in patients receiving amiodarone could result in reduced @DRUG$ levels.
1	DDI-false	Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of @DRUG$ (@DRUG$) when given usual doses.
2	DDI-advise	Therefore, co-administration of @DRUG$ with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants (e.g., @DRUG$, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
3	DDI-advise	@DRUG$ should not be taken closely in time with aluminum and @DRUG$ containing antacids.
4	DDI-false	In rats, simultaneous ingestion of disulfiram and @DRUG$ in the diet for 78 weeks has been reported to cause tumors, and it has been suggested that @DRUG$ may react with nitrites in the rat stomach to form a nitrosamine, which is tumorigenic.
5	DDI-false	Caution should be used when administering or taking TARCEVA with @DRUG$ and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as, but not limited to, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, @DRUG$, telithromycin, troleandomycin (TAO), and voriconazole .
6	DDI-false	MAO inhibitors, @DRUG$ (e.g., @DRUG$), nitrates and nitrites, sympathomimetic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs having anticholinergic activity.
7	DDI-false	@DRUG$: The effect of amprenavir on total drug concentrations of other @DRUG$ in subjects receiving both agents was evaluated using comparisons to historical data.
8	DDI-false	Patients taking disopyramide phosphate and @DRUG$ concomitantly may develop increased serum concentrations of @DRUG$ resulting in excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval.
9	DDI-false	Co-administration of lovastatin, atenolol, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, celecoxib, @DRUG$, ramipril, valsartan, metformin and @DRUG$ did not result in clinically significant increases in aliskiren exposure.
10	DDI-false	In a comparison of digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with ketamine, @DRUG$, or pentobarbital, the dosage of ouabain needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher, as was the LD50 of ouabain, with ketamine or @DRUG$ than with pentobarbital.
11	DDI-false	OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies, @DRUG$ was used concomitantly with angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, @DRUG$, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions.
12	DDI-advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If @DRUG$ is co-administered with @DRUG$ Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
13	DDI-int	Possible drug interactions of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ or with other anticholinesterase agents.
14	DDI-mechanism	"Ascorbic acid: Doses of ascorbic acid (@DRUG$) 1 g/day have been reported to increase plasma concentration of @DRUG$ by ~47%, possibly by inhibiting conjugation;"
15	DDI-effect	@DRUG$ in combination with other narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, @DRUG$, tranquilizers, sedative-hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) has additive depressant effects.
16	DDI-effect	Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that @DRUG$ can reduce the natriuretic effect of @DRUG$ and thiazides in some patients.
17	DDI-mechanism	In a study in which the 2 mg @DRUG$ orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without @DRUG$ (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the Cmax of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.
18	DDI-effect	Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of @DRUG$ such as NIMBEX include certain antibiotics (e. g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistemethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, @DRUG$, and quinidine.
19	DDI-mechanism	Cimetidine: @DRUG$ increases @DRUG$ plasma levels.
20	DDI-mechanism	Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone: Coadministration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ resulted in a 47% decrease in ethinyl estradiol and an 18% decrease in norethindrone plasma concentrations.
21	DDI-effect	ACE inhibitors: Reports suggest that @DRUG$ may diminish the antihypertensive effect of @DRUG$.
22	DDI-effect	A direct causal relationship has not been established, but physicians should consider the possibility that @DRUG$ may alter a diabetic patient s response to @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents.
23	DDI-mechanism	The daily dose of @DRUG$ administered in clinical studies with @DRUG$ reflects an approximate 50% reduction of the dose of dexamethasone.
24	DDI-effect	This appears to be the only clinically relevant interaction of this kind with @DRUG$, although theoretically, coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (eg, anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, @DRUG$ or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval.
25	DDI-mechanism	Cyclosporine: Administration of @DRUG$ concomitantly with @DRUG$ has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin.
26	DDI-mechanism	Ephedrine: @DRUG$ may enhance the metabolic clearance of @DRUG$, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.
27	DDI-mechanism	@DRUG$ has been shown to induce the metabolism of @DRUG$ and tolbutamide, which are metabolized through CYP2C9.
28	DDI-effect	Platelet inhibitors: Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, @DRUG$ and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving @DRUG$.
29	DDI-advise	Literature reports suggest that oral @DRUG$ may be used in combination with @DRUG$ when heart function is normal, but should be avoided in patients with impaired cardiac function.
30	DDI-advise	therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the @DRUG$ dose may be necessary when @DRUG$ is administered concomitantly.
31	DDI-advise	In long surgical procedures during @DRUG$ or isoflurane anesthesia, less frequent maintenance dosing, lower maintenance doses, or reduced infusion rates of @DRUG$ may be necessary.
32	DDI-effect	The effects of @DRUG$ were very strong and completely depressed the @DRUG$-induced hyperlocomotion.
33	DDI-effect	Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of @DRUG$: @DRUG$, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide.
34	DDI-advise	Multivitamins, or other products containing iron or zinc, antacids or @DRUG$ should not be administered concomitantly with, or within 2 hours of, the administration of @DRUG$, because they may interfere with absorption resulting in lower serum and urine levels of norfloxacin.
35	DDI-effect	There are rare reports, however, from marketing experiences, of changes in effects of @DRUG$ or oral hypoglycemic agents in the presence of @DRUG$ that necessitated changes in the doses of such agents.
36	DDI-advise	- Perhexiline hydrogen maleate or @DRUG$ (with hepatotoxic potential) must not be administered together with @DRUG$ or Bezalip retard.
37	DDI-advise	"Before taking @DRUG$, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: - aspirin or another salicylate such as magnesium/choline salicylate (Trilisate), salsalate (Disalcid, others), choline salicylate (Arthropan), magnesium salicylate (Magan), or @DRUG$ (Pepto-Bismol);"
38	DDI-advise	If @DRUG$ therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of @DRUG$.
39	DDI-mechanism	Morphine: A literature article reported that when a 60-mg controlled-release @DRUG$ capsule was administered 2 hours prior to a 600-mg @DRUG$  capsule (N=12), mean gabapentin AUC increased by 44% compared to gabapentin administered without morphine.
