7231	DDI-effect	The uptake inhibitors cocaine and @DRUG$ (3 mumol/liter) potentiated the positive inotropic effects of @DRUG$ in nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05) but not in functional class IV myocardium.
7232	DDI-false	Radioligand binding experiments using the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 @DRUG$ revealed a significant decrease by approximately 30% in @DRUG$ uptake-1 carrier density in functional classes II to III and IV myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05).
7233	DDI-false	@DRUG$ (5-35 micromol/l) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries preconstricted with @DRUG$ (8 micromol/l) or KCl (125 mmol/l) from both lean and dietary-obese rats.
7234	DDI-false	@DRUG$ (5-35 micromol/l) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries preconstricted with noradrenaline (8 micromol/l) or @DRUG$ (125 mmol/l) from both lean and dietary-obese rats.
7235	DDI-false	Resveratrol (5-35 micromol/l) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of mesenteric arteries preconstricted with @DRUG$ (8 micromol/l) or @DRUG$ (125 mmol/l) from both lean and dietary-obese rats.
7236	DDI-false	This study indicates that: (a) the maximal effects of @DRUG$ on resistance arteries from lean and dietary-obese rats are not effected by endothelial dysfunction, and (b) the effects of @DRUG$ in lean animals (where endothelial function is not impaired), but not in dietary-obese rats, are mediated via NO.
7237	DDI-false	Behavioral responses to repeated @DRUG$ exposure in mice selectively bred for differential sensitivity to @DRUG$.
7238	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for @DRUG$, and urine was analyzed for @DRUG$ and its two metabolites, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide by means of HPLC.
7239	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for @DRUG$, and urine was analyzed for tolbutamide and its two metabolites, @DRUG$ and carboxytolbutamide by means of HPLC.
7240	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for @DRUG$, and urine was analyzed for tolbutamide and its two metabolites, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and @DRUG$ by means of HPLC.
7241	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for tolbutamide, and urine was analyzed for @DRUG$ and its two metabolites, @DRUG$ and carboxytolbutamide by means of HPLC.
7242	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for tolbutamide, and urine was analyzed for @DRUG$ and its two metabolites, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and @DRUG$ by means of HPLC.
7243	DDI-false	Plasma was analyzed for tolbutamide, and urine was analyzed for tolbutamide and its two metabolites, @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ by means of HPLC.
